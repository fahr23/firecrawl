**Abstract:**

> Abstract
          Reactive magnesium oxide cement (RMC) is emerging as a sustainable binder in construction applications due to its ability to sequester CO2 through carbonation, forming stable carbonates. However, the efficiency of RMC carbonation relies heavily on maintaining sufficient humidity and CO2 concentration during curing. Various additives—including hydration agents, carbonate species, and seeds—have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing both hydration and carbonation of RMC, there...

**Abstract:**

> Power-to-Hydrogen is crucial for the renewable energy transition, yet existing literature lacks business models for the significant excess heat it generates. This study addresses this by evaluating three models for selling electrolyzer-generated heat to district heating grids: constant, flexible, and renewable-source hydrogen production, with and without heat sales. Using agent-based modeling and multi-criteria decision-making methods (VIKOR, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE), it finds that selling excess heat...

**Abstract:**

> Coal’s rising prominence in the power industry has raised concerns about future CO2 emissions and energy reliability. As of 2017, it is estimated that Malaysia’s existing natural gas production can only be maintained for another 40 years. Consequently, the carbon intensity of electricity production has increased due to the increasing share of coal-fired plants and electricity infrastructure inefficiencies. To summarise, energy industries have been the highest emitters of CO2 emissions, with a 54...

**Abstract:**

> Rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems could significantly contribute to renewable energy production and reduce domestic energy costs. In Italy, as in other countries, the current incentives generate a modest annual increase after the generous fiscal incentives that kick-started the PV market in the 2008–2013 period. Several factors are, however, at play that can speed up the installation process, such as the improvements in PV technology at declining prices, the increased availability of batte...

**Abstract:**

> Even though biomass is characterised as renewable energy, it produces anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially from biomass logistics. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool to quantify the GHG emissions from logistics but in the past the majority of LCAs have been steady-state and linear, when in reality, non-linear and temporal aspects (such as weather conditions, seasonal biomass demand, storage capacity, etc.) also have an important role to play. Thus, the objective of ...

Clearly, we need to make massive changes in our lifestyles if we are to get anywhere near ‘sustainability’. In this paper, an ‘agent-based model’ is developed which for this initial presentation explores probable impacts on household consumption and emissions of possible innovations. The model randomly picks a large number (here 10,000, but it can be much...

> Power systems have undergone major changes, mainly due to the increasing penetration of renewable distributed generation and levels of automation. Prosumers have the capability to become (almost) independent of the grid and can exchange energy with other community members. In this setting, it is relevant to exploit generation/demand flexibility from an energy community perspective, including multiple agents that exchange and manage the available energy resources in an integrated manner.

**Abstract:**

> The ongoing deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) calls for an enhanced integration of RES into energy markets, accompanied by a new set of regulations. In Germany, for instance, the feed-in tariff legislation for renewables has been successively replaced by first optional and then obligatory marketing of RES on competitive wholesale markets. This paper introduces an agent-based model that allows studying the impact of changing energy policy instruments on the economic performance of RES ...

**Abstract:**

> In this research, several improvements to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) were analysed. The EU ETS is a market for emission allowances and the European Union's main instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (of which CO2 is the main component). However, the CO2 allowance price in this market has been highly volatile and generally too low to stimulate significant long-term reductions in CO2 emissions. National and system-wide price floors and ceilings were investigate...

Biomass can be used to replace part of the fossil-based reducing agents in blast furnace without compromising the quality of the final product. The advantage of biomass compared to fossil-based fuels is that it is renewable energy source and can thus be considered carbon dioxide neutral within specified system boundaries. Few studies have been conducted where the effec...
