      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of energy, economic, and environmental policies on Türkiye’s energy dynamics and CO2 emissions using climate models and an agent-based simulation (ABM) framework. By integrating climate projections with policy scenarios, it assesses how energy transitions and climate change affect renewable energy sources (RES), cooling demands, and CO2 emissions from electricity generation. Methods include selecting suitable Global Climate Models (GCMs), evaluating climate change impacts on RES performance, and simulating policy effects through ABM across one base and nine policy scenarios from 2023 to 2040. The study highlights the critical role of policy interventions in influencing emissions trends and energy prices. It identifies renewable energy subsidies and low-carbon strategies, such as nuclear power support, as effective tools for reducing emissions and stabilizing energy costs. The methodologies and findings provide actionable insights for policymakers globally, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate data with policy planning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               Ambitious decarbonization mandates and rising volatility in energy markets demand decision-support tools that can learn, adapt, and generalize beyond the static optimization frameworks that dominate contemporary energy transition modelling. Addressing this gap, we articulate and validate a Deep Q-Network agent that learns investment policies in a custom OpenAI Gym environment tailored to the dynamics of national energy mixes. The environment is parameterized with an open Eurostat panel (2012–2021, 24 indicators, 430 country–year records), cleaned to 173 observations and compressed to a 16-dimensional state vector via PCA after k-NN imputation, outlier filtering, and min-max normalization. The agent selects among marginal allocations to renewables, fossil fuels, or nuclear capacity. Rewards balance renewable-share growth against carbon-intensity reduction, and episodes span 25 simulated years. After 1 200 training episodes (≈5 min on a Google TPU), the Deep Q-Network converges within 200 episodes and outperforms a myopic greedy baseline by 4.98 utility units (average reward = –19.34 ± 11.06 versus –24.32 ± 10.09), while delivering a 27% improvement in CO2-intensity metrics (0.421 versus 0.331 t CO2/MWh). From this paper, researchers can gain an extensible benchmark that integrates publicly reproducible data, an openly specified environment, and a modular MLOps pipeline. Practitioners—policy-makers, regulators, utilities, and clean-energy investors - obtain an interpretable agent whose learned policies expose the long-run trade-offs between renewable deployment speed and carbon-abatement efficacy. By demonstrating that deep reinforcement learning can produce stable, near-optimal strategies under structural uncertainty and high-dimensional state spaces, the study furnishes both methodological and practical impetus for embedding adaptive, data-driven intelligence in future energy-transition analyses.",

      "abstract": "The building energy performance gap (BEPG) remains a significant challenge, undermining the accuracy of energy simulations and complicating efforts to design energy-efficient buildings. This study addresses this issue by developing an adaptive occupant behaviour framework for office buildings, integrating agent-based modelling (ABM) with a building performance simulation (BPS) platform. Conventional BPS models often rely on deterministic assumptions and overlook the dynamic, stochastic nature of occupant interactions, such as window and blind operations. By incorporating occupant-driven behaviours, this research enhances the realism of energy predictions and provides insights into reducing the BEPG. Focusing on a multi-functional office building at the University of Nottingham, the study used empirical data to validate the model. The ABM framework simulated occupant behaviours influenced by factors like indoor and outdoor temperatures, solar radiation, clothing levels, and metabolic rates. Profiles generated by the ABM were integrated into the energy model, creating an Adjust model compared against a Base model with deterministic settings. Validation against measured boiler energy use showed that the Baseline model over-predicted consumption by roughly 45 %, whereas the behaviour-informed Adjust model cut the deviation to about 26 %, albeit under-predicting the total load. Statistical analyses revealed improvements in mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), although hourly energy predictions remained a challenge. Additionally, the Adjust model provided a more realistic representation of thermal comfort, reducing variability in the predicted mean vote (PMV) index from extreme values in the Base model to a more stable range in the Adjust model. However, the Adjust model also predicted higher indoor CO2 concentrations, particularly in individual offices, due to reduced ventilation associated with occupant actions. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating ABM with BPS models to address modelling discrepancies by capturing detailed and dynamic occupant interactions, emphasising the importance of adaptive behaviours in improving prediction accuracy and occupant well-being.",

      "abstract": "The global transition to renewable energy has intensified the focus on anaerobic digestion (AD) as a sustainable solution for organic waste management and biogas production. This study presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis (TEA) of AD systems integrated with carbon capture and digestate treatment technologies, evaluated across four distinct operational scenarios. The research leverages an innovative AI-agent framework to streamline TEA, enabling stakeholders to conduct sophisticated analyses without specialized expertise. Key findings reveal that feedstock composition significantly impacts biogas yields, with maize and rye blends (mix2) outperforming maize-dominated mixes (mix1), achieving higher biogas production (26,029 m3/y vs. 23,182 m3/y). Membrane-based CO2 separation and liquefaction technologies demonstrated superior economic viability compared to cryogenic methods, yielding lower energy consumption (2400 MWh/y vs. 3000 MWh/y) and higher net revenues (GBP 4.0 million/y vs. GBP 3.5 million/y). Financial metrics further underscored the advantages of membrane-based systems, with the mix2 configuration achieving a net present value (NPV) of GBP 19 million and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 36%, alongside a shorter payback period (3 years). Sensitivity analysis highlighted natural gas prices and tax rates as critical determinants of economic performance, while water costs had negligible impact. The study also evaluated digestate treatment methods, finding that base-case separation outperformed torrefaction in financial returns.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n          Reactive magnesium oxide cement (RMC) is emerging as a sustainable binder in construction applications due to its ability to sequester CO2 through carbonation, forming stable carbonates. However, the efficiency of RMC carbonation relies heavily on maintaining sufficient humidity and CO2 concentration during curing. Various additives—including hydration agents, carbonate species, and seeds—have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing both hydration and carbonation of RMC, thereby improving its mechanical performance. This study explores the use of biochar—a highly porous, carbon-based by-product of biomass pyrolysis—as a sustainable and cost-effective carbonation aid by evaluating its impact on the physical, rheological, mechanical, and microstructural properties of RMC composites. The results showed that the incorporation of 2 wt% biochar significantly improved early-age mechanical performance, with compressive strength increasing from 37.8 to 45.8 MPa at 7-days under CO2 curing, and promoted the formation of hydrated magnesium carbonates (HMCs), raising total HMCs content from 5.4 to 13.9 wt% at 7-days under CO2 curing. This improvement is attributed to biochar’s micro-filler effect, internal curing capability and its ability to facilitate CO2 diffusion. Moreover, the inclusion of biochar effectively shortened the curing time, further enhancing the sustainability of CO2 curing by reducing energy consumption. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of biochar as a bio-renewable additive in RMC-based composites, enhancing brucite and HMCs formation, shortening CO2-curing time and contributing to development of sustainable, carbon-efficient construction materials.",

This study addresses this by evaluating three models for selling electrolyzer-generated heat to district heating grids: constant, flexible, and renewable-source hydrogen production, with and without heat sales. Using agent-based modeling and multi-criteria decision-making methods (VIKOR, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE), it finds that selling excess heat can cut hydrogen production costs by 5.6%. The optimal model operates flexibly with electricity spot prices, includes heat sales, and maintains a hydrogen price of 3.3 EUR/kg. Environmentally, hydrogen production from grid electricity could emit up to 13,783.8 tons of CO2 over four years from 2023. The best economic and environmental model uses renewable sources and sells heat at 3.5 EUR/kg",

      "abstract": "An agent-based modeling framework is developed and employed to replicate the interactions among urban farms. The objectives are to efficiently manage an urban farm’s food, energy, and water resources, decrease food waste, and increase the food availability for the local community. A case study of eleven farms was investigated in Vancouver, Canada to study the linkages between the resources in the urban food, energy, and water nexus. Each urban farm in the simulation belonged to a community microgrid generating electricity from solar and wind. The local farms aimed to provide fresh produce for their respective local communities. However, at some points, they lacked supply, and at other points, there was excess supply, leading to food waste. Food waste can be converted into fertilizers or bioenergy. However, an alternative solution must be employed due to the natural resources required for production, efficiently managing resources, and adhering to sustainability guidelines. In this paper, an optimization framework was integrated within the agent-based model to create a micro supply chain. The supply chain directly linked the producers with the consumers by severing the links involved in a traditional food supply. Each urban farm in the study collaborated to reduce food wastage and meet consumer demands, establishing farmer-to-farmer exchange in transitional agriculture. The optimization-based micro supply chain aimed to minimize costs and meet the equilibrium between food supply and demand. Regular communication between the farms reduced food waste by 96.9% over 16 weeks. As a result, the fresh food availability increased for the local community, as exemplified by the consumer purchases over the same period. Moreover, the simulation results indicated that the renewable energy generation at the community microgrids aided in the generation of 22,774 Mwh from solar and 2568 Mwh from wind. This has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in areas that heavily rely on non-renewable energy sources.",

      "abstract": "The depletion of fossil-based fuels, fluctuating fuel market, and environmental deterioration demand an aggressive approach towards the advancement of renewable energy technologies. By the time reliable technology for a clean and abundant energy supply is established, existing sources must be economized. Biomass gasification is the way forward in that direction. CFD modeling shows promise in the development of advanced gasification systems. A simplified 3D CFD model of a downdraft gasifier is developed to investigate the effect of gasifying agent composition on the quality of syngas. Simulation results are compared with published experimental data and found to be in reasonably good agreement. Mixing CO2 with a gasification agent is also investigated as a possible carbon capture and utilization (CCU) strategy. An air-steam mixture is used as a base-case gasification agent. Firstly, the effect of air-to-steam ratio on syngas composition is investigated. Secondly, the effect of oxygen and mixing CO2 with a gasification agent is investigated in two separate cases. A 50%-50% air-steam mixture is found to produce the best quality syngas. Oxygen is found to have a negligible impact on the quality of syngas. The air-steam-CO2 = 23%-50%-15% mixture is found to be optimum regarding syngas quality.",

In Italy, as in other countries, the current incentives generate a modest annual increase after the generous fiscal incentives that kick-started the PV market in the 2008–2013 period. Several factors are, however, at play that can speed up the installation process, such as the improvements in PV technology at declining prices, the increased availability of battery-storage (BS) systems, the growing use of electric appliances, the uptake of electric cars, and the increased environmental awareness. We integrate two research methodologies, discrete choice modeling and agent-based modeling, to understand how these factors will influence households’ decisions regarding PV and BS installations and how agents interact in their socioeconomic environment. We predict that in Italy, given the preference structure of homeowners, the continuing decline in costs, and the social interaction, 40–45% of homeowners will have PV or PV and BS installed by 2030, thanks to the existing investment tax credit policy.",

As‐prepared catalysts were thoroughly characterized using powder X‐ray diffraction, electron microscopy, elemental analysis, vibrating sample magnetometer, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. High conversion and selectivity toward methane were observed at mid‐temperature range, hence improving energy efficiency of the process with respect to the previous results under magnetic heating conditions. To gain further insight into the catalytic system, the effects of the synthesis method and of 0.5 wt % Ru doping were evaluated.

Inter alia, the bidding decisions are based on the assessment of electricity market prices and generation forecasts (Nitsch, Deissenroth-Uhrig, et al., 2021), and diverse actors deciding on different time scales may be modelled. In particular, the agents’ behavior does not only reflect marginal prices, but can also consider effects of support instruments like market premia, uncertainties and limited information, or market power (Frey et al., 2020). This allows assessing which policy or market design is best suited to an economic and effective energy system (Torralba-Díaz et al., 2020).

One important output of the model are simulated market prices (Deissenroth et al., 2017).",

      "abstract": "Community energy systems as decentralized and collective renewable energy systems, where the energy is jointly generated and distributed among a community of households, are gaining momentum. The collective action of individual households as a core characteristic of such energy systems influences the energy availability, energy costs, and eventually, their energy security. This study investigates the influence of individual households' behavioural attributes on the energy security of such collective energy systems. An agent-based model was built based on the following energy security dimensions: availability, affordability, accessibility and acceptability, referred to as the 4A's concept. The research focused on thermal energy communities given the considerable share of thermal energy applications, such as heating, cooling, and hot tap water. The simulation results demonstrated that such communities could cost around 1250 €/year while reducing their CO2 emissions by 50% on average. Environmentally friendly behaviour leads to higher energy security performances. Such behaviours considerably influence the technical configurations while contributing positively to affordability and acceptability dimensions of collective energy security of thermal energy systems. Furthermore, the investment size of individual households was found to be the most influential parameter for energy security performances, while natural gas prices were identified as the least impactful parameter.",

In this paper, a hybrid system based on the multi-agent approach and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast the energy production and its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and simulate the potential emission reduction in case of switching to renewable energy sources is presented. The proposed system's architecture consists of combining LSTM models with the agent-based technology, where multiple LSTM forecasting models were trained to forecast the production of each type of the studied energies and then estimate the equivalent emitted CO2 and calculate the influence of the renewable energy inputs on the carbon emissions and the fossil fuels consumption. The simulation process consists of two phases: firstly, each forecasting agent uses a specific LSTM model to forecast short-term energy production. Secondly, these agents send the forecasted values to the coordination agent who is responsible for calculating the total CO2 emissions and the benefits of the renewable energy inputs.",

      "abstract": "Power markets are becoming increasingly complex as they move towards (i) integrating higher amounts of variable renewable energy, (ii) shorter trading intervals and lead times, (iii) stronger interdependencies between related markets, and (iv) increasing energy system integration. For designing them appropriately, an enhanced understanding of the dynamics in interrelated short-term physical power and energy markets is required, which can be supported by market simulations. In this paper, we present an agent-based power market simulation model with rule-based bidding strategies that addresses the above-mentioned challenges, and represents market participants individually with a high level of technical detail. By allowing agents to participate in several interrelated markets, such as the energy-only market, a procurement platform for control reserve and a local heat market representing district heating systems, cross-market opportunity costs are well reflected. With this approach, we were able to reproduce EPEX SPOT market outcomes for the German bidding zone with a high level of accuracy (mean absolute percentage error of 8 €/MWh for the years 2016–2019). We were also able to model negative market prices at the energy-only market realistically, and observed that the occurrence of negative prices differs among data inputs used. The simulation model provides a useful tool for investigating different short-term physical power/energy market structures and designs in the future. The modular structure also enables extension to further related markets, such as fuel, CO2, or derivative markets.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart meters devices in smart grids is providing key support for measuring and analyzing the power consumption patterns. This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures. &copy; 2022 IEEE.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "The transition process towards renewable energy systems is facing challenges in both fluctuating electricity generation of photovoltaic and wind power as well as socio-economic disruptions. With regard to sector integration, solutions need to be developed, especially for the mobility and the industry sector, because their ad hoc electrification and decarbonization seem to be unfeasible. Power-to-fuel (P2F) technologies may contribute to bridge the gap, as renewable energy can be transferred into hydrogen and hydrocarbon-based synthetic fuels. However, the renewable fuels production is far from economically competitive with conventional fuels. With a newly developed agent-based model, potential developments in the German energy markets were simulated for a horizon of 20 years from 2016 to 2035. The model was constructed through a participatory modeling process with relevant actors and stakeholders in the field. Model findings suggest that adjusted regulatory framework conditions (e.g., exemptions from electricity surtaxes, accurate prices for CO2-certificates, strong start-up subsidies, and drastic emission reduction quotas) are key factors for economically feasible P2F installations and will contribute to its large-scale integration into the German energy system. While plant capacities do not exceed 0.042 GW in a business-as-usual scenarios, the above-mentioned adjustments lead to plant capacities of at least 3.25 GW in 2035 with concurrent reduction in product prices.",

      "abstract": "PurposeObviously, the development of a robust optimization framework is the main step in energy and climate policy. In other words, the challenge of energy policy assessment requires the application of approaches which recognize the complexity of energy systems in relation to technological, social, economic and environmental aspects. This paper aims to develop a two-sided multi-agent based modelling framework which endogenizes the technological learning mechanism to determine the optimal generation plan. In this framework, the supplier agents try to maximize their income while complying with operational, technical and market penetration rates constraints. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the proposed planning approach. The results showed that considering the endogenous technology cost reduction moves optimal investment timings to earlier planning years and influences the competitiveness of technologies. The proposed integrated approach provides not only an economical generation expansion plan but also a cleaner one compared to the traditional approach.Design/methodology/approachTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, so far there has not been any agent-based generation expansion planning (GEP) incorporating technology learning mechanism into the modelling framework. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a multi-agent based modelling for long-term GEP and undertakes to show how incorporating technological learning issues in supply agents behaviour modelling influence on renewable technology share in the optimal mix of technologies. A case study of the electric power system of Iran is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed planning approach and also to demonstrate its efficiency.FindingsAs seen, the share of the renewable technology agents (geothermal, hydropower, wind, solar, biomass and photovoltaic) in expanding generation increases from 10.2% in the traditional model to 13.5% in the proposed model over the planning horizon. Also, to incorporate technological learning in the supply agent behaviour leads to earlier involving of renewable technologies in the optimal plan. This increased share of the renewable technology agents is reasonable due to their decreasing investment cost and capability of cooperation in network reserve supply which leads to a high utilization factor.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, so far there hasn’t been any agent-based GEP paying attention to this integrated approach.

      "abstract": "The German Energiewende is a deliberate transformation of an established industrial economy towards a nearly CO2-free energy system accompanied by a phase out of nuclear energy. Its governance requires knowledge on how to steer the transition from the existing status quo to the target situation (transformation knowledge). The energy system is, however, a complex socio-technical system whose dynamics are influenced by behavioural and institutional aspects, which are badly represented by the dominant techno-economic scenario studies. In this paper, we therefore investigate and identify characteristics of model studies that make agent-based modelling supportive for the generation of transformation knowledge for the Energiewende. This is done by reflecting on the experiences gained from four different applications of agent-based models. In particular, we analyse whether the studies have improved our understanding of policies’ impacts on the energy system, whether the knowledge derived is useful for practitioners, how valid understanding derived by the studies is, and whether the insights can be used beyond the initial case-studies. We conclude that agent-based modelling has a high potential to generate transformation knowledge, but that the design of projects in which the models are developed and used is of major importance to reap this potential. Well-informed and goal-oriented stakeholder involvement and a strong collaboration between data collection and model development are crucial.",

      "abstract": "Even though biomass is characterised as renewable energy, it produces anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially from biomass logistics. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool to quantify the GHG emissions from logistics but in the past the majority of LCAs have been steady-state and linear, when in reality, non-linear and temporal aspects (such as weather conditions, seasonal biomass demand, storage capacity, etc.) also have an important role to play. Thus, the objective of this paper was to optimise the environmental sustainability of forest biomass logistics (in terms of GHG emissions) by introducing the dynamic aspects of the supply chain and using the geographical information system (GIS) and agent-based modelling (ABM). The use of the GIS and ABM adds local conditions to the assessment in order to make the study more relevant. In this study, GIS was used to investigate biomass availability, biomass supply points and the road network around a large-scale combined heat and power plant in Naantali, Finland. Furthermore, the temporal aspects of the supply chain (e.g., seasonal biomass demand and storage capacity) were added using ABM to make the assessment dynamic. Based on the outcomes of the GIS and ABM, a gate-to-gate LCA of the forest biomass supply chain was conducted in order to calculate GHG emissions. In addition to the domestic biomass, we added imported biomass from Riga, Latvia to the fuel mixture in order to investigate the effect of sea transportation on overall GHG emissions. Finally, as a sensitivity check, we studied the real-time measurement of biomass quality and its potential impact on overall logistical GHG emissions. According to the results, biomass logistics incurred GHG emissions ranging from 2.72 to 3.46 kg CO2-eq per MWh, depending on the type of biomass and its origin. On the other hand, having 7% imported biomass in the fuel mixture resulted in a 13% increase in GHG emissions. Finally, the real-time monitoring of biomass quality helped save 2% of the GHG emissions from the overall supply chain. The incorporation of the GIS and ABM helped in assessing the environmental impacts of the forest biomass supply chain in local conditions, and the combined approach looks promising for developing LCAs that are inclusive of the temporal aspects of the supply chain for any specific location.",

Thus the key point is to develop low-cost, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for CO2RR. To benefit from their exposed active sites and to maximize atomic efficiency, single-metal atom catalysts that usually show high activities are required. Herein, we unravel the trends in the reactivity and selectivity of atomically isolated M–N4 (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) sites within porous porphyrinic triazine framework (metal single atoms/PTF) for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. We found that NiSAs/PTF exhibited the highest faradaic efficiency (98%) at a mild potential of −0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and the highest turnover frequency of 13,462 h−1 for the production CO at an applied potential of −1.2 V. The relations of catalytic performance of CO2 to CO over the different active M–N4 sites were unraveled by the combination of density functional theory calculations and experiments. This work gives an extensive mechanistic understanding of the selectivity of CO2 to CO from the M–N4 sites at an atomic scale, thus it will bring new inspiration for the design of highly efficient CO2RR. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction The large-scale use of fossil fuels has led to a substantial increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, hence causing environmental problems, including global warming and sea-level rise.1–3 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value-added chemicals and fuels using renewable electricity is a promising strategy to balance the global carbon emission.4–6 Among the electroreduction products, CO is considered one of the most valuable industrial feedstocks, which can be used for the catalytic Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to produce hydrocarbon liquid fuels.7,8 Fortunately, compared with other CO2RR processes, the reduction of CO2 to CO [CO2 + 2H++ 2e− → CO + H2O, −0.11 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] needs only two electron/proton transfers,9 which makes it an essentially less-hindered pathway.10 Nevertheless, due to the low energetic efficiency, sluggish electron transfer kinetic, poor selectivity, and low stability of electrode materials significant challenges remain that impede the practical use and technological commercialization result from the inert chemical bond of CO2 (C = O, 806 kJ·mol−1)11 and the accompanied competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).12,13 Furthermore, the high cost and scarcity of noble metal catalysts, such as Au- and Ag-based catalysts, limit their large-scale applications.14,15 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficient earth-abundant metal-based electrocatalysts specifically for CO2 to CO conversion with long durability to meet the practical application. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically isolated metal atoms anchored on supports usually show high activity and selectivity toward various catalytic performances because of their maximum atom efficiency, exposed active sites, and tunable coordination microenvironment.16–18 Thus, SACs anchored on conductive materials such as porous carbons and graphene have displayed great potential to enhance their performance in CO2RR.19–22 However, the preparation of stable and highly efficient SACs remains a great challenge because of the high surface energy of their single atoms and easy formation of inactive aggregates.23,24 Moreover, mechanistic understanding of the relationships between the CO2RR reactivity and the structures of SACs is still elusive, which impedes further designing of highly efficient SACs for the CO2RR.25–27 Porous covalent triazine frameworks constructed by 1,3,5-triazine linkers have attracted much attention in gas adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis because of their high specific surface area, high nitrogen contents, and remarkable acid/base stability.28–30 Recently, our group reported that the porphyrin architectures stabilized Fe/Co single atoms within porphyrinic triazine frameworks (PTF), which can behave as accessible active sites for highly efficient electrocatalysis for oxygen reduction reaction and HER.31,32 Herein, a series of atomically isolated M–N4 sites anchored on highly porous porphyrinic triazine framework [metal single atoms (MSAs)/PTF, M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co] were prepared and employed as electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Among these single-atom metal elements, Ni material, NiSAs/PTF, was found to have a very high faradaic efficiency (FE), between 94% and 98% for CO generation over a wide range of applied potential (−0.6 to −1.2 V) versus RHE (RHE scale was used as a reference for all applied potential scales). Impressively, NiSAs/PTF reached a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 13,462 h−1 at a mild applied potential of −1.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that NiSAs/PTF and FeSAs/PTF have more positive estimated electrochemical limiting potentials than those of CoSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF. The rate determining step for NiSAs/PTF, CoSAs/PTF, and CuSAs/PTF is the *COOH intermediate formation, whereas, with FeSAs/PTF, it is the last step of CO desorption that seemed to be rate determining. Furthermore, the CO2RR occurs easier than the HER over the coordinately unsaturated Ni–N4 site in NiSAs/PTF. Results and Discussion The atomically isolated Ni–N4 and Cu–N4 sites anchored by porphyrin moieties within porous porphyrinic triazine framework (denoted as NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, respectively) were prepared via a one-pot ionothermal trimerization reaction of the corresponding 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-cyanophenyl)porphyrinato]-M (M-TPPCN, M = Ni, Cu), catalyzed by the molten zinc chloride as Lewis acid at 600 °C for 40 h (Figure 1). After washing with diluted hydrochloric acid for NiSAs/PTF or nitric acid for CuSAs/PTF, followed by deionized water and ethanol, black powder samples were obtained after oven drying in vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. The FeSAs/PTF and CoSAs/PTF materials containing single-atom sites of Fe–N4 and Co–N4, were prepared respectively, according to a previously reported method.31,32 The polymerization reaction and formation of polytriazine networks were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared analysis (). The disappearance of the carbonitrile stretching band at ca. 2225 cm−1 demonstrated that the conversion of the monomers M-TPPCN (M = Ni, Cu) was completed successfully. Meanwhile, a strong absorption band at 1587 cm−1 assigned to triazine rings was observed, indicating the success of the trimerization reaction.33,34 Figure 1 | Schematic illustration of the fabrication of MSAs/PTF (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Download figure Download PowerPoint The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF (Figure 2a) are similar to those of Fe- and CoSAs/PTF,31,32 indicating that all the MSAs/PTF have amorphous structures. A prominent wide peak, centered at ca. 25.6° was apparent, which could be assigned to the amorphous (001) reflection of aromatic sheets.35 In addition, a weak peak at ca. 43.0° corresponding to the appearance of (101) reflection of graphitic carbon, and also, indicated that their graphitization occurred at 600 °C. Notably, there was no evidence of an appearance of diffraction peak relative to metal-based particles or carbides. Strikingly, the results obtained from the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy () revealed that the samples NiSAs/PTF, CuSAs/PTF, FeSAs/PTF, and CoSAs/PTF have high corresponding metal contents of 1.11, 0.82, 2.60, and 0.85 wt%, respectively. Thus, we deduced that these metals may possess an atomic-level distribution and that single-atom metals were successfully embedded in the PTFs. The Raman spectra (Figure 2b) also showed no peak of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, as they were similar to the Fe- and CoSAs/PTF samples.31,32 Moreover, these samples have high IG/ID ratios (where IG and ID represent the G-band and D-band intensity, respectively) and a broad weak two-dimensional (2D) peak at ca. 2800 cm−1, suggesting that partial graphitization phenomenon had occurred and graphitic layered structures were presented in the catalysts. The Nyquist plots from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for the MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu, Co, and Fe) further demonstrated that these materials have small semicircles (Figure 2c and ), and that the partial graphitized structures are beneficial for improving the electron transfer rate between the interfaces of the catalyst and the electrolyte, thus enhancing CO2RR activity. Figure 2 | (a) PXRD patterns, (b) Raman spectra of NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, (c) Nyquist plots, and (d) CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 273 K for FeSAs/PTF, CoSAs/PTF, NiSAs/PTF, and CuSAs/PTF. Download figure Download PowerPoint The nitrogen adsorption measurements revealed that all the MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) samples have high N2 adsorption uptake and large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas in the range of 454–873 m2 g−1 (). Moreover, distinct hysteresis loops were observed at the P/Po range of 0.45–1.0, indicating meso- and/or macropores were formed in all the MSAs/PTF materials, attributed to the porogenic agent zinc chloride.36 The pore size distributions based on the nonlocal DFT method () for the MSAs/PTF family further revealed that their pores are in the range of 0.7–9.9 nm. The hierarchically porous structure could imply that the single-atom metal active sites are highly accessible to the reactive species and electrolytes, thus facilitating mass transportation and improving energy conversion efficiency. The CO2 adsorption isotherms further revealed that all the MSAs/PTF materials have large adsorption capacities, ranging from 52–97 cm3 g−1 at 273 K (Figure 2d), illustrating that there was a strong interaction between these nitrogen-rich MSAs/PTF materials and CO2 molecules, which, in turn, enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of CO2RR. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM with subangstrom resolution measurements were further used to confirm the atomic levels of the metal sites. As shown in the TEM (Figure 3a and ) and HAADF-STEM (Figure 3d and ) images of the NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, no obvious NPs were observed, a finding which is consistent with their PXRD (Figure 2a) and Raman results (Figure 2b). Notably, the TEM element mapping images (Figure 3c and ) show that Ni and Cu elements are uniformly distributed at atomic-level throughout the architecture of NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, respectively. In addition, a large number of bright spots related with the heavier Ni and Cu elements with atomic dispersion could be seen in the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images for NiSAs/PTF (Figure 3b) and CuSAs/PTF (), respectively.37–42 These results suggested that single-atom metal sites within NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF have been fabricated successfully. Figure 3 | (a) TEM images of NiSAs/PTF. (b) Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images showing the atomic dispersion of Ni in NiSAs/PTF. HAADF image (c) and corresponding C, N, and Ni EDS elemental mapping. Download figure Download PowerPoint In order to confirm the local chemical environment of single-atom metals, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was first employed. As shown in , the N 1s signal band of all the MSAs/PTF materials split into three-type configurations, originating from triazinic N (398.5 eV), porphyrinic-like metal-coordinated M–Nx (399.7 eV), and graphitic N (401.1 eV) species.43,44 The high-resolution metal 2p XPS spectra of MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu) are displayed in . As shown in the fitted Ni 2p spectrum, two dominated peaks were centered at 855.4 eV (2p3/2) and 872.5 eV (2p1/2), similar to those of Ni2+ in Ni-TPPCN (855.3 and 872.6 eV, ), but higher than the Ni(0) metal (854.3 and 871.9 eV).45 The Fe 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 are 709.6 and 780.6 eV, which are near to those of Fe2+ and Co2+, respectively.31,32 As for CuSAs/PTF, the dominating signals at binding energies of 935.8 eV (2p3/2) and 955.9 eV (2p1/2) are originated from the positive Cu–N bond.46,47 These results revealed that all the metals are significantly positive, implying that no metal NPs were detected,48 which are in good agreement with PXRD (Figure 2a) and the TEM results (Figure 3a). Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy was further performed to confirm the coordination environment of these single-atom metals in MSAs/PTF. As shown in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of the Ni K-edge in NiSAs/PTF (Figure 4a), both of the pre-edge and absorption edge energy position of NiSAs/PTF are located in between Ni foil and NiO, indicating that the Ni single atoms carried positive charges between metallic Ni(0) and the fully oxidized states Ni(II),49 consistent with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) () and electron paramagnetic resonance results ().50 Moreover, a weak pre-edge peak (A position) at ca. 8330 eV appeared in NiSAs/PTF, and the precursor Ni-TPPCN was attributed to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition (1s → 3d), which suggested that hybridization of 3d and 4p orbitals of the Ni central atoms had occurred.9 Additionally, a strong peak at ca. 8336 eV (peak B) was observed in both of NiSAs/PTF and the precursor Ni-TPPCN, which was due to the 1s → 4pz transition. These transitions serve as fingerprints for square-planar configuration with D4h centrosymmetry, and confirm that the NiSAs/PTF contains Ni–N4 porphyrin-like moieties originating from the Ni-TPPCN monomer. Furthermore, the relatively larger intensity ratio for peaks C and D than Ni-TPPCN, in which the two peaks are associated with the 1s → 4px,y transitions and multiple scattering processes, respectively, are expected to show good electrocatalytic performances. In addition, the Ni L-edge XANES spectrum () of NiSAs/PTF displayed a distinctive single peak related to 3d-electrons at the L3-edge, which is similar to Ni rather than Ni-based oxides.51 The N K-edge of the XANES spectrum of NiSAs/PTF () shows a resonance peak of the π*-transition pyrrolic-N that bonded to Ni atoms to form Ni–Nx species. The formation of Ni–Nx was confirmed further by the observation of weak π* peak assigned to sp2-hybridized carbon of C–N–Ni in C K-edge of NiSAs/PTF (). Figure 4 | (a) Normalized Ni K-edge XANES spectra of the Ni-TPPCN, NiSAs/PTFs, NiO, and Ni foil. (b) Normalized Cu K-edge XANES spectra of the CuSAs/PTFs, Cu-TPPCN, Cu2O, CuO, and Cu foil.

Download figure Download PowerPoint For the XANES spectrum of CuSAs/PTF, its absorption edge energy was positioned between Cu foil and Cu(II)-TPPCN (Figure 4b), suggesting partial Cu atoms in CuSAs/PTF had been reduced to Cu(I). A similar phenomenon was also found in FeSAs/PTF, in which the Fe atoms have been reduced to Fe(II) from Fe(III) of Fe-TPPCN at high synthesis temperature.31 Moreover, the pre-edge peak at 8985 eV was similar to the monomer Cu-TPPCN, which is associated with 1s → 4pz shakedown transition feature for a square-planar configuration with high D4h symmetry structure. These results indicated that Cu–N4 porphyrin-like structure predominates in CuSAs/PTF, which is similar to that of NiSAs/PTF, FeSAs/PTF, and CoSAs/PTF.31,32 Concurrently, in the Fourier-transform, k3-weighted χ(k) function of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for NiSAs/PTF (Figure 4c) exhibited a strong major peak at 1.44 Å associated with Ni–N/O, which is similar to the monomer Ni-TPPCN (1.47 Å), suggesting that the Ni atoms coordinated with N elements. Furthermore, no obvious peak at the positions of Ni foil was observed for NiSAs/PTF sample, indicating that no Ni–Ni bond was presented in NiSAs/PTF. These results suggested that no Ni NP was formed, and all Ni sites were in atomically isolated form, which is also consistent with the PXRD and aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM results. In addition, the fitting results from EXAFS analysis in Figure 4e showed that the coordination number of Ni species in NiSAs/PTF is ca. 4.0 (), suggesting that the Ni porphyrin-like structure was retained, which agreed well with the XANES results (Figure 4a). The same analysis for CuSAs/PTF (Figure 4d) also revealed that Cu NPs were absent, and the single copper atoms adopted identical coordination configuration to NiSAs/PTF with Cu–N4 structure (Figure 4f and ), which was similar to the Fe–N4 and Co–N4 in FeSAs/PTF and CoSAs/PTF.31,32 Inspired by the unique structures of these MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) materials, their activities relative to CO2RR were then evaluated by observing their performance in a gas-tight H-type electrochemical cell, separated by a Nafion-117 proton exchange membrane. The comparison of the CO2RR activities of these materials is summarized in Figure 5. As shown in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 5a, it was apparent that at CO2-saturated (1 atm), 0.5 M KHCO3, all the MSAs/PTF materials exhibited much more positive onset potentials and higher current densities than those in N2-saturated, 0.5 M KHCO3, suggesting that their activities might have originated from CO2 reduction. CoSAs/PTF exhibited a small onset potential of which was much more positive than that of FeSAs/PTF NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF V) (Figure Figure | (a) in the CO2-saturated and 0.5 M at a rate of (b) CO current density of MSAs/PTF at various (c) at various applied (d) at various applied Download figure Download PowerPoint The reduced and for these catalysts at different potentials within 0.5 h are displayed in Figure Notably, no liquid was found in spectroscopy and the CO and were by gas in the applied potential range between and −1.2 V versus a of was found using FeSAs/PTF electrode ().

      "abstract": "The plasma gasification offers more benefits compared to the conventional gasification. Those benefits include the better environmental issue such as lower emission, variated feedstock and higher energy recovery, including hydrogen and waste heat. Waste to energy technology is developed as a means of waste management to obtain new and renewable energy, due to the increasingly amount of waste produced by the growing population. The feedstock use is municipal solid waste (MSW) from TPA Jatibarang in Semarang City, Central Java. Along with population growth, energy supply becoming a very crucial issue in the near future. Converting the waste to energy would overcome the two crucial issues at once. With high temperature, the plasma gas decompose the feedstock into its constituent element and within thermochemical equilibrium stoichiometry, the syngas was formed. This model was developed based on plasma arc technology and able to estimate the syngas composition, energy required for the reaction and also the CO2 emission. This study is to obtain the crucial parameter which was involved to get the highest of hydrogen, highest syngas yield, highest efficiencies along with lowest its emission. Results shows that, the use of 100% steam as gasifying agent and steam to waste ratio (SWR) of 34,48%, can produce 48,33% of H2, Syngas Yield is 9,26 Nm3/kg, Cold Gasification Efficiency is 58.60% and its emission is 0.864 kg/hr.",

The integration of renewable power generation, energy storage, and demand response algorithms has led to the development of complex structures for managing the increasing energy demands. This paper proposes a decentralised multi-agent based demand response algorithm designed for a smart grid that relies on photovoltaic generation while feeding both a green data centre and supplying the residential load demand. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to minimise the total daily costs incurred due to shortfalls in the solar energy generation. The cost optimisation is performed by taking the user inconvenience of the residential load and the energy cost into account.

      "abstract": "An important aspect of any scientific approach to sustainability must be methods by which the impacts of possible innovations can be assessed. Clearly, we need to make massive changes in our lifestyles if we are to get anywhere near ‘sustainability’. In this paper, an ‘agent-based model’ is developed which for this initial presentation explores probable impacts on household consumption and emissions of possible innovations. The model randomly picks a large number (here 10,000, but it can be much larger) of households from four different countries and calculates the effects resulting from the adoption of specific innovations. The ‘lifestyle’ of the households within the area studied is divided into four different ‘domains’. These are living, food, mobility and energy. Innovations are launched in the four different domains and the model shows the overall effects on the total input requirements (materials, energy, etc.), the household and food wastes and the CO2 emissions, showing how far the system moves towards sustainability. By using the sustainability criteria of 8000 kg ‘input material’ per year per individual developed by the Wuppertal Institute (Lettenmeier et al. in Resources 3:488–515, 2014, https://doi.org/10.3390/resources3030488, http://www.mdpi.com/journal/resources, ISSN 2079-9276), we can calculate how far the nation or region is from sustainability after adopting possible innovations. This is a measure of the total inputs required per individual per year. It allows us to show that for different countries, with widely different climates (e.g. Finland and Spain), different household innovations would have a greater or lesser impact on attaining ‘sustainable lifestyles’. The model does not pretend to develop a full simulation of each system, including the ecosystem, type of economy, etc., but does look at the effect an innovation in one household domain will have on all four domains, thereby providing information that can improve current decisions. It also demonstrates that, although ‘households’ can do much to improve the situation by reducing their demand for energy and materials, some actions at a national/regional level will be required to achieve sustainability. For example, sustainability will require an end to the use of fossil fuels for transportation and a switch to ‘clean’ electrical power generation from renewables and nuclear sources. Without this change, these countries will find it impossible to reach a sustainable lifestyle.",

Agent-based modeling (ABM) tools have been increasingly used to model complex energy systems, since they are especially suited to model systems influenced by social interactions between agents that are flexible, autonomous and proactive.

      "abstract": "The ongoing deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) calls for an enhanced integration of RES into energy markets, accompanied by a new set of regulations. In Germany, for instance, the feed-in tariff legislation for renewables has been successively replaced by first optional and then obligatory marketing of RES on competitive wholesale markets. This paper introduces an agent-based model that allows studying the impact of changing energy policy instruments on the economic performance of RES operators and marketers. The model structure, its components, and linkages are presented in detail; an additional case study demonstrates the capability of our sociotechnical model. We find that changes in the political framework cannot be mapped directly to RES operators as behaviour of intermediary market actors has to be considered as well. Characteristics and strategies of intermediaries are thus an important factor for successful RES marketing and further deployment. It is shown that the model is able to assess the emergence and stability of market niches.",

      "abstract": "An agent-based framework for modelling and simulation of resource management in self-sustainable human settlements is presented and tested on a realistic scenario including energy production with photovoltaic panels. The results of the simulation showed that the framework was able to prolong the self-sustainability of the observed settlement with regards to the overall energy production, storage and demands in the simulation environment. A detailed simulation analysis is provided, as well as system optimization using a number of heuristics. Specifically developed agent classes, behaviours and protocols are proposed that allow to model and simulate the dynamics of local resource production, storage and consumption in order to pursue and evaluate self-sustainability of a settlement at hand. The framework can be used by a modeler either to design and simulate a new self-sustainable system, or to evaluate and analyze an existing system. The presented framework enables considerable improvements in the design of a settlement and its resource production, consumption and storage elements, in regard to the context of self-sustainability.",

To reduce this environmental impact it is important to design efficient energy infrastructures able to deal with high level of renewable energy resources. A crucial element in this design is the quantitative understanding of the dynamics behind energy demands such as transport, electricity and heat. In this paper an agent-based simulation model is developed to generate residential energy demand profiles in urban areas, influenced by factors such as land use, energy infrastructure and user behaviour. Within this framework, impact assessment of low carbon technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles and heat pumps is performed using London as a case study. The results show that the model can generate important insights as a decision support tool for the design and planning of sustainable urban energy systems.",

      "abstract": "In this research, several improvements to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) were analysed. The EU ETS is a market for emission allowances and the European Union's main instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (of which CO2 is the main component). However, the CO2 allowance price in this market has been highly volatile and generally too low to stimulate significant long-term reductions in CO2 emissions. National and system-wide price floors and ceilings were investigated, prompted by the UK’s implementation of a CO2 price floor through a supplementary CO2 tax. The effects of the \"backloading\" of CO2 allowances and the proposed Market Stability Reserve were also investigated. While the latter measures may increase dynamic efficiency, this research showed that a well-designed price corridor is even more efficient, while still achieving the long-term abatement targets and stabilising prices. Furthermore, different methods for adjusting the CO2 emissions cap in response to changes in renewable energy policies were investigated. Finally, the impact of investors' risk aversion on the functioning of the CO2 market was evaluated. The analyses were conducted with the use of EMLab-Generation, an agent-based model that simulates two interconnected electricity markets with a joint CO2 emissions trading system. In this model, the companies have limited knowledge about the future, which makes it possible to investigate the impact of public policy instruments on long-term investment dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Replacement of fossil carbon by renewable biomass-based carbon is an effective measure to mitigate CO2 emission intensity in the blast furnace ironmaking process. Depending on the substitution rate of fossil fuels, the required amount of biomass can be substantial. This raises questions about the availability of biomass for multiple uses. At the same time, the economic competitiveness of biomass-based fuels in ironmaking applications should also be a key consideration. In this assessment, availability of energy wood, i.e., logging residues, small-diameter wood and stumps, in Finland is discussed. Since biomass must be submitted to a thermochemical process before use in a blast furnace, the paper describes the production chain, from biomass to charcoal, and economics related to each processing step. The economics of biomass-based reducing agents is compared to fossil-based ones by taking into account the effect of European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The assessment reveals that there would be sufficient amounts of energy wood available for current users as well as for ironmaking. At present, the economics of biomass-based reducing agents in ironmaking applications is unfavorable. High CO2 emission allowance prices would be required to make such a scheme competitive against fossil-based reducing agents at current fuel prices.",

      "abstract": "Biomass use has been identified as one of the possibilities to mitigate fossil greenhouse gas emissions in iron and steelmaking. Biomass can be used to replace part of the fossil-based reducing agents in blast furnace without compromising the quality of the final product. The advantage of biomass compared to fossil-based fuels is that it is renewable energy source and can thus be considered carbon dioxide neutral within specified system boundaries. Few studies have been conducted where the effect of biomass introduction to blast furnace process have been evaluated with mathematical modeling or lab-scale experiments. The other body of literature concerns the life cycle based assessments. This study presents the effects of biomass use in plant site scale with energy balances and CO2 reduction potential. For the evaluation purposes integrated steel plant model based on physico-chemical relationships was developed. The model can be used for calculating gate-to-gate life cycle inventory for evaluating the environmental burden of the integrated steel plant. Effect of charcoal as tuyére injectant to blast furnace process was firstly evaluated. The results indicate that to replace 1 kg of specific heavy oil, 1.15 kg charcoal would be needed. Plant-wide effects of two distinct charcoal usage scenarios were evaluated and compared to base case scenario with fossil-based reducing agents. Plant site evaluation suggests that by introducing biomass to integrated steel plant, major changes in energy balances occur and significant fossil CO2 emission reduction can be achieved. This study indicates that 15.4 to 26.4% reduction in fossil CO2 emissions could be achieved in plant scale.",

      "abstract": "Today?s electrical energy landscape is characterized by new challenges such\n   as deregulation, liberalization of energy markets, increased competition,\n   growing demands on security of supply, price insecurities, and demand to cut\n   CO2 emissions. All mentioned challenges are calling for consideration of\n   various options (like nuclear, coal, gas or renewable scenarios) and for\n   better understanding of energy systems modelling in order to optimize proper\n   energy mix. Existing models are not sufficient any more and planners will\n   need to think differently in order to face these challenges. European\n   emission trading scheme (EU ETS) started in 2005 and it has great influence\n   on power system short term and long term planning. Croatia is obliged to\n   establish a national scheme for trading of greenhouse gas emission allowances\n   from the year 2010, which will be focused on monitoring and reporting only\n   until accession to EU when it will be linked with EU ETS. Thus, for Croatian\n   power system it is very important to analyze possible impacts of CO2\n   emissions. Analysis presented in this paper was done by two different models:\n   mathematical model, based on short run marginal costs (SRMC, relevant for\n   fuel switch in existing power plant and merit order change) and long run\n   marginal costs (LRMC, relevant for new investment decisions); and electricity\n   market simulation model PLEXOS, which was used for modelling Croatian power\n   system during development of the Croatian energy strategy in 2008. Results of\n   the analysis show important impacts that emission trading has on Croatian\n   power system, such as influence of emission price rise on price of\n   electricity and on emission quantity, and changes in power plants output that\n   appear with emission price rise. Breakeven point after which gas power plant\n   becomes more competitive than coal is 62 ?/tCO2 for SRMC and 40 ?/tCO2 for\n   LRMC. With CO2 prices above 31 ?/tCO2 wind is more competitive than gas or\n   coal, which emphasizes importance that emission price has on competitiveness\n   of renewables.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this research in progress is to examine the effect of CO2-emission trading and the intensified application of renewable energy sources to the liberalized power market. The research approach applies methods from a combination of economics, natural sciences and computer science in order to obtain decision support for the planning of future power plant structures, investment decisions, and emission scales. Besides the liberalization, future power markets are increasingly influenced by regulatory acts which are mainly responding to the necessity of a structured reduction of CO2-emissions. For CO2-eminssions, which are generated by the production of electric power, an emission trading system with obligatory participation is being launched from 2005 on. Since in the same period, the amount of power which has to be produced from renewable energy sources is increased dramatically, an additional incoming aspect is the fluctuating character of many of those sources. These changed general conditions in the industrial power sector cause novel structures at international power markets and additionally a new emissions situation. The aim of this research is the conception of a methodologically innovative concept to simulate power markets based on multi-agent systems (MAS) and agent-based computational economics (ACE) which fulfils the described desiderata. Since heterogeneous utility functions for individual market participants can be modelled - in comparison to existing centrally steered simulation methods - a multi-agent based simulation approach promises more realistic simulation results. Specific behaviour and the dynamic adoption of the strategies of individual participants based on the experiences derived from market behaviour can explicitly be simulated. The aim of the research approach is to obtain a strengthened understanding of the mutual effects among heterogeneous participants and the dynamics of the market of CO2-emissions as well as renewable energy resources. To disseminate these results, acting recommendations for participants at international power markets as well as political and regulatory authorities are derived.",
