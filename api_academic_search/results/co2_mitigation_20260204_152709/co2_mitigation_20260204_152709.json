This study estimates a model of these effects using Asian rice yield data merged with free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experimental data. A three-stage generalized least squares model is developed to quantify their effects on mean rice yields and their variance. The results show that CO2 concentration has significantly contributed to increased rice yields, accounting for 16–26% of observed yield growth over 1990–2015. This indicates that if significant CO2 mitigation occurs, the CO2 fertilization effect will diminish, inducing a yield reduction. This finding suggests that increased agricultural research and development investments are needed to overcome not only adverse climate change effects but also to counteract CO2 mitigation effects on rice yields.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n                  \n                    Climate change is a significant concern for our world, mostly caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. The issue is evident in rising sea levels, melting glaciers, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO\n                    2\n                    ) levels, decreasing forest and wildlife populations, and disturbances to aquatic ecosystems. Immediate mitigation techniques are crucial to reducing CO2 emissions. Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) is a prominent method now being examined. This method encompasses capturing, transferring, and storing CO\n                    2\n                    underground, or converting CO\n                    2\n                    into fuels and chemicals. Diversifying CCUS methods, such as CO\n                    2\n                    utilisation, helps in reaching the goal of having net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. This study examines the hydrogenation process of CO2, with a specific focus on producing methane utilising a combined catalytic reactor system. Modular components containing renewable hydrogen and photovoltaic solar systems are placed on top of a haulage cabin. Experiments in the cabin use CO2:H2 gas ratios from 1:3.6 to 1:4.5 at temperatures between 150°C and 250°C. Using a specific TNB Research catalyst, the catalytic methanation reaction shows positive outcomes, reaching a CO\n                    2\n                    conversion rate of up to 97% and methane production at lower temperatures (250°C) than traditional methanation methods. The system achieves CO\n                    2\n                    conversion rates ranging from 80% to 90% even when supplied with less than stoichiometric amounts of H2, indicating a possible annual CO\n                    2\n                    utilisation of up to 2.2 tonnes as a part of mitigation strategies. Yet, economic assessments show that the levelized cost of methane (LCOM) is still relatively expensive in comparison to market prices, highlighting the need for additional cost-cutting measures to ensure future sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Urban CO2 mitigation strategies typically aim at particular zones or sectors but do not account for spatial interdependencies among different components within the city. Understanding how land uses emit within and across districts can reveal systemic leverage points for climate-resilient urban planning. This study applies a bipartite spatial network approach using high-resolution Urban Atlas land-use data and a hierarchical spatial framework for emissions and sequestration estimation. The approach links urban land uses to their emissions profiles, offering a structural view of how different areas interconnect within urban carbon dynamics, moving beyond fragmented emission accounting. Using the Reggio Calabria Functional Urban Area in Italy as a case study, the analysis identifies influential areas and emission-intensive land uses. Subsequently, using centrality metrics highlights the spatial units with strong connections to emission-dense land uses, marking them as points of intervention. Results show that although 53% of districts act as net carbon sinks, their sequestration capacity is outweighed by the intensity of a smaller group of emitter districts. Among these, five central districts (IDs 94, 82, 107, 108, and 72) emit over 500 million kg CO2 per year, making them leverage points for systemic mitigation. The integration of bipartite spatial network and multiscale territorial analysis provides a replicable, data-driven framework for urban CO2 mitigation. Ultimately, the study demonstrates that mapping emissions through spatial interdependencies enables planners to target interventions where localized action yields the greatest network-wide climate impact.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n          Forests can play a key role in the mitigation of climate change, although there have been limited regional scale assessments that account for variations in soil type and tree species. Most of the focus has been on their ability to sequester atmospheric CO2, while there is less information on the two other major greenhouse gases (GHGs), N2O and CH4. We examined the GHG budgets of ten forest soils in Poland, considering all three major GHGs, where no previous long-term measurements had been made, which encompassed different tree species, stand age, and contrasting edaphic conditions. In addition to the quantification and assessment of seasonal variability in the major soil GHG fluxes over two years, the aims of the present study were (i) the identification of the main drivers of the soil-based GHG fluxes, (ii) the determination of the contribution of each gas to the Global Warming Potential (GWP), and (iii) to assess the mitigation potential of these fluxes over different forest systems. All the forest soils were sources of CO2 and N2O and sinks for atmospheric CH4 with pronounced seasonal variations in CO2 and CH4 driven by soil moisture and temperature. The soils showed significant differences in annual GHG fluxes, with average values of 16.7 Mg CO2 ha−1, − 3.51 kg CH4 ha−1, and 0.95 kg N2O ha−1. The annual total GWP ranged from 13.1 to 22.0 Mg CO2 eq ha−1 with CO2 making the highest contribution, and forest-specific CH4 uptake resulting in a reduction in GWP, ranging from − 0.08% (in the youngest forest) to -0.97% (in the oldest forest). Mixed forests showed the greatest potential for climate change mitigation, with the highest soil C sequestration, and the lowest GWP values when compared to sites with monocultures. The results suggest that a mixture of tree species could eventually be incorporated into management plans to increase the effectiveness of forests in climate change mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               Drought is expected to intensify with rising CO2, but its behavior under CO2 mitigation, remains uncertain. The response of the climate system to CO2 variation exhibits hysteresis and irreversibility, highlighting the difficulty of recovery and the potential for long-lasting impacts. We investigated the hysteresis and reversibility of global drought and the associated underlying drivers. The Community Earth System Model 2 was used to simulate CO2 changes: linear increases, decreases (i.e. net negative), and restoration to the initial level. This paper incorporates three well-established indices based on atmospheric, meteorological and soil moisture data to reflect drought. Here, we show that drought is dominant during the CO2 decrease phase, leading to strong hysteresis with irreversible behavior over more than half of the global land cover. The robust irreversible changes in drought are concentrated in specific areas, i.e. hotspots, covering over 11% of the global land and are particularly pronounced in Northern Africa, Southwest Russia, and Central America. A decrease in precipitation drives drought during the CO2 increase phase, while an enhanced vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbates it during the CO2 decrease phase. This increased VPD exacerbates drought hysteresis by raising potential evapotranspiration. Our findings suggest that only CO2 reduction is not enough to effectively mitigate drought impacts, rather advanced water management strategies are essential.",

      "abstract": "\n \n Precisely tailoring the electronic effect of catalytic sites remains a fundamental challenge in the field of artificial photosynthesis. Particularly, the strategies for regulating orbital and electronic state via the Jahn–Teller (J–T) effect at the atomic level for boosting CO\n 2\n photoreduction remain rarely investigated. Herein, a rational mitigation strategy is demonstrated via a single‐atom modification in metal‒organic assemblies which enables precise control over the J–T effect and thereby regulates the electron density at the locally catalytic Fe sites. Through rational ligand design, a nanolayer (\n 1\n ) exhibiting mitigated J–T distortion and a nanoribbon (\n 2\n ) with pronounced J–T distortion are synthesized. Remarkably, the photocatalyst\n 1\n achieves a more rapid CO production rate of 10.91 mmol g\n −1\n h\n −1\n under visible light, nearly double that of\n 2\n (6.19 mmol g\n −1\n h\n −1\n ). A combination of experimental analyses, including single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, XPS, magnetic susceptibility, and in situ DRIFTS, as well as DFT calculations, reveals that the mitigation of the J–T effect noticeably enhances the charge density at the Fe active sites, which boosts CO\n 2\n adsorption and activation, and ultimately promotes CO generation. This work demonstrates the prominence of the J–T engineering photocatalysts and highlights the potential of regulating orbital and electronic degeneracies for boosting artificial photosynthesis.\n",

Although several soil physicochemical factors regulating microbial activity are well known, the role of soil solution viscosity remains largely unexplored. This study evaluated how polyethylene glycol (PEG6000)-induced increases in soil solution viscosity affect microbial activity-derived CO2 emissions in a Rhodic Ferralsol (eutric). Three concentrations of PEG6000 (50, 75, and 100 g L−1), corresponding to viscosities of 1.93, 2.76, and 3.88 cP, respectively, were compared to a water-based control (1.11 cP). Soil CO2 emissions, soil O2 capture, temperature, and water content were measured over a 60-day period using standard methods. Results showed significant reductions in cumulative CO2 emissions of 20%, 25%, and 12% for PEG6000 treatments, respectively, compared to the control. Decreased O2 capture at viscosities of 1.93 and 2.76 cP (50 and 75 g L−1, respectively) indicated reduced microbial activity. These findings reveal a previously underappreciated biophysical mechanism regulating soil carbon emissions. Understanding and managing soil solution viscosity could offer a novel strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions in tropical soils, thus contributing to climate change mitigation and sustainable soil management, particularly in highly weathered tropical ecosystems.",

This study evaluates the carbon sequestration and emission reduction potential of EbA interventions implemented in degraded forests and rangelands of Nepal to quantify their climate mitigation outcomes. Carbon sequestration was estimated using secondary data from national sources and literature for two types of interventions: reforestation of 1,393 hectares and Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) over 10,000 hectares. Standardized carbon stock increments from similar ecological zones were applied over 20 years. Reforested areas sequestered an average of 83.4 tons of CO2 per hectare per year, while sustainably managed forests contributed 4.4 tons of CO2 per hectare per year. Over 20 years, these measures are projected to sequester approximately 1,134 t CO2/ha from plantations and 533 t CO2/ha from SFM. EbA interventions in Nepal not only build adaptive capacity but also provide significant climate mitigation benefits. The observed carbon gains highlight the importance of incorporating ecosystem restoration into national climate policies, especially in forest and rangeland landscapes where adaptation and mitigation collaborations can be achieved.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe international climate accounting system excludes both the biogenic CO2 sequestered in harvested crops and the biogenic CO2 emissions that occur when grain is digested or burned as biofuel. Despite being described in the literature as a critical flaw in climate accounting all parties within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change continue to treat these large biogenic CO2 fluxes as carbon‐neutral activities, while analysis of the accounting issue remains largely absent from the extensive literature examining international carbon leakage and GHG mitigation policy. Using a partial‐equilibrium trade model, I analyse the economic implications of measuring harvested‐grain biogenic CO2 and find in the presence of traded grain and internationally heterogeneous GHG mitigation policy, measurement would change optimal domestic agricultural GHG mitigation policy. Given estimated CO2 damage costs of $185/t, the unmeasured external biogenic benefit from grain production, and the unmeasured external biogenic cost from grain consumption, are equal in magnitude to the price of grain. Including the biogenic harvested‐grain CO2 in Canada's national inventory reduces measured emissions by 80 million tonnes per year. The size of these effects suggest that the measurement of harvested‐grain biogenic CO2 could be extremely consequential for the design of optimal GHG mitigation policy.JEL Classifications: Q15, Q54",

We utilise a new primary dataset based on interviews with the most knowledgeable stakeholders of ODA on climate change mitigation. Additionally, we use secondary data from the annual Rio Marker and the Common Reporting Standard data of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The results show a significant correlation between climate-related development aid and CO2 emission reduction in Indonesia. Additionally, the implementation of the Busan Principles enhances aid management by fostering project ownership and increasing the involvement of the civil society and private sector. The study has implications in devising an effective climate change mitigation strategy for Indonesia.

In each home, participants were asked to cook as usual, but to record their cooking activities and mitigation efforts (windows, ventilation fans, etc.). All homes showed enhanced pollutants during, and immediately after, times of cooking or stove use. For each home, we quantified the minutes per day and minutes per minute of cooking over known health thresholds for each pollutant. On average, homes exhibited 38 min per day over one or more of these thresholds, with PM2.5 and NO2 being the pollutants of greatest concern. Six homes had much higher occurrences over the health thresholds, averaging 73 min per day. We found an average of 1.0 min over one or more of the health thresholds per minute of cooking when no mitigation was used, whereas when mitigation was used (filtration or vent fan), this value was reduced by 34%. We further investigated several mitigation methods including natural diffusion, a commercial HEPA filter unit, a commercial O3 scrubber and a ventilation fan. We found that the HEPA unit was highly effective for PM2.5 but had no impact on any of the gaseous pollutants. The O3 scrubber was moderately effective for NO2 but had little impact on the other pollutants. The ventilation fan was highly effective for all pollutants and reduced the average pollutant lifetime significantly. Under controlled test conditions, the pollutant lifetime (or time to reach 37% of the original concentration), was reduced from an average of 45 min (with no ventilation) to 7 min. While no commercial filter showed efficacy for both PM2.5 and NO2, the fact that each could be removed individually suggests that a combined filter for both pollutants could be developed, which would significantly reduce health impacts in homes with gas stoves.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n          Agriculture is a key contributor to gaseous emissions causing climate change, the degradation of water quality, and biodiversity loss. The extant climate change crisis is driving a focus on mitigating agricultural gaseous emissions, but wider policy objectives, beyond net zero, mean that evidence on the potential co-benefits or trade-offs associated with on-farm intervention is warranted. For novelty, aggregated data on farm structure and spatial distribution for different farm types were integrated with high-resolution data on the natural environment to generate representative model farms. Accounting for existing mitigation effects, the Catchment Systems Model was then used to quantify global warming potential, emissions to water, and other outcomes for water management catchments across England under both business-as-usual and a maximum technically feasible mitigation potential scenario. Mapped spatial patterns were overlain with the distributions of areas experiencing poor water quality and biodiversity loss to examine potential co-benefits. The median business-as-usual GWP20 and GWP100, excluding embedded emissions, were estimated to be 4606 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 (inter-quartile range 4240 kg CO2 eq. ha−1) and 2334 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 (inter-quartile range 1462 kg CO2 eq. ha−1), respectively. The ratios of business-as-usual GHG emissions to monetized farm production ranged between 0.58 and 8.89 kg CO2 eq. £−1 for GWP20, compared with 0.53–3.99 kg CO2 eq. £−1 for GWP100. The maximum mitigation potentials ranged between 17 and 30% for GWP20 and 19-27% for GWP100 with both corresponding medians estimated to be ~24%. Here, we show for the first time that the co-benefits for water quality associated with reductions in phosphorus and sediment loss were both equivalent to around a 34% reduction, relative to business-as-usual, in specific management catchment reporting units where excess water pollutant loads were identified. Several mitigation measures included in the mitigation scenario were also identified as having the potential to deliver co-benefits for terrestrial biodiversity.",

Using panel data spanning the period 2000 to 2022, the research investigates how tourism, FinTech—defined as digital innovations in financial services including green finance—and resource governance, measured through natural resource rents, contribute to reducing carbon emissions. The study employs Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) to examine the heterogeneous effects of these variables across different levels of CO2 emissions and applies Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) for robustness testing to ensure the reliability of the findings. The results reveal that while economic growth and urbanization tend to exacerbate emissions, eco-tourism, FinTech, and resource governance exhibit varying impacts across emission quantiles. Notably, eco-tourism demonstrates strong potential in mitigating CO2 emissions, especially in regions facing higher environmental stress. This study emphasizes the importance of targeted policies that promote sustainable tourism practices, harness FinTech for green innovation, and reinforce resource governance. By offering actionable policy insights, it provides a roadmap for E7 nations to integrate these strategic levers into their climate action agendas, thereby advancing both environmental and economic sustainability.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThis paper extends the climate literature by examining the feasibility of integrating sub‐national governance into global club governance for mitigating CO2 emissions. Global climate clubs become an argument for having separate bundles of emission targets and incentive mechanisms in the form of opportunities for climate finance and technology sharing among the club members. An exploratory analysis is important to examine the role of import and export taxes and other channels, such as the clean development mechanism, in meeting the objective of nonmember countries to join the club. The crux, however, is how, after determining national‐level quotas, the mitigation responsibilities are shared with subnational entities. We propose a design of a carbon entry tax at the subnational level, namely states, districts, and municipalities. The carbon entry tax uses the nighttime luminosity data published by NASA as a measure of carbon, which constitutes the tax base. The carbon entry tax serves as a fiscal instrument of decarbonization in a decentralized framework.",

According to the IPCC, forests have a lot of potential for mitigating climate change. The forest area in Mount Tidar Botanical Garden (MTBG) is used as a tourist attraction and is known as the most famous religious tourism object in Magelang. Tourist activities in MTBG are massive, tourist attractions are open 24 hours a day and never close, causing an enormous amount of CO2 emissions. This study aims to determine the total CO2 emissions of tourism activities, CO2 sequestration in vegetation MTBG, and provide recommendations on the types of vegetation that have the highest CO2 sequestration. This study is quantitative research. Primary data collection was done by taking data on vegetation diameter and LPG usage around the restaurant. The Data were analyzed by emission estimation and the allometric formula. The results showed that the total CO2 emissions from human respiration, the use of LPG, and vehicles amounted to 481,665 tons/year. The ability of plants in the MTBG forest has the potential to CO2 sequestration of 1.260,170 tons. Forests in MTBG can support climate change mitigation efforts in accordance with Sustainable Development Goals 13 because they can handle emissions with a surplus of 778,506 tons of CO2. Vegetation types that have high CO2 sequestration are Ficus benjamina, Calliandra calothyrsus, and Spathodea campanulata.",

Thus, this research examined the influence of people's behavior toward the air pollution mitigation program to calculate the effectiveness of the mitigation program on CO2 reduction and assess the most effective air pollution mitigation program. The research was conducted based on a questionnaire survey of 100 respondents from 31 sub‐districts in Surabaya. Mitigation programs studied were liquid petroleum gas (LPG) conversion, biodiesel conversion, car‐free day, P and P system (emission test and vehicle periodic maintenance), composting, and reduction of plastic usage. The correlation analysis method was used to analyze the data. Based on the results of the analysis, LPG was the most influential program that affected people's behavior because it was mostly implemented by 92% of respondents. The CO2 emission was reduced to 66.38% by implementing the air pollution mitigation program. The most effective mitigation program was the P and P system.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe bubble column reactor of 10 and 20 L capacity was designed to bio-mitigate 10% CO2 (g) with 90% air utilizing thermophilic bacteria (Bacillus cereus SSLMC2). The maximum biomass yield during the growth phase was obtained as 9.14 and 10.78 g L−1 for 10 and 20 L capacity, respectively. The maximum removal efficiency for CO2 (g) was obtained as 56% and 85% for the 10 and 20 L reactors, respectively. The FT-IR and GC–MS examination of the extracellular and intracellular samples identified value-added products such as carboxylic acid, fatty alcohols, and hydrocarbons produced during the process. The total carbon balance for CO2 utilization in different forms confirmed that B. cereus SSLMC2 utilized 1646.54 g C in 10 L and 1587 g of C in 20 L reactor out of 1696.13 g of total carbon feed. The techno-economic assessment established that the capital investment required was $286.21 and $289.08 per reactor run of 11 days and $0.167 and $0.187 per gram of carbon treated for 10 and 20 L reactors, respectively. The possible mechanism pathways for bio-mitigating CO2 (g) by B. cereus SSLMC2 were also presented utilizing the energy reactions. Hence, the work presents the novelty of utilizing thermophilic bacteria and a bubble column bioreactor for CO2 (g) bio-mitigation.",

      "abstract": "While greening vacant houses is encouraged as a sustainable strategy, there is a paucity of quantitative research on its effects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the flood risk and CO2 mitigation effects of greening neglected vacant houses and barren sites in densely built old downtown areas. To achieve this goal, an investigation was conducted of the actual conditions of vacant houses and barren sites in Ami-dong and Chojang-dong in Busan Metropolitan City. Subsequently, four scenarios for greening vacant houses and barren sites were developed, and rainfall runoff simulations were performed using the K-LIDM model. Furthermore, the annual CO2 fixation for greening with trees was calculated using established research formulas. This study found that 73% of vacant houses in the study area remain unoccupied for an extended period, and when demolished, 56% become concrete-paved barren sites. The runoff simulations indicated that greening with trees led to a 1.71% decrease in annual runoff volume in the long-term model, with peak runoff volume reductions of 3.06% and 2.38% during 2-year and 30-year rainfall events in the short-term model, respectively. Planting trees could accommodate 3058 trees, fixing 62,124 kg of CO2 annually. This study demonstrates the climate change response effects of greening vacant houses.",

Analyzing the synergistic relationship between PM2.5 and CO2 in urban green spaces has become an important part of promoting pollution control. The study investigated the influence and synergistic relationship between the spatial pattern of community parks on PM2.5 and CO2 in Xi’an City, Shaanxi Province, through practical measurement and ENVI-met/Open Studio simulation calculations. The results showed that: (1) Within the sphere of influence, community parks exhibit a positive synergy varying with distance, peaking at 400 m and declining as 300 m &gt; 500 m &gt; 200 m &gt; 100 m. (2) The green space rate, total edge (TE), and mean patch shape index (SHAPE_MN) positively influence the synergistic mitigation of PM2.5 and CO2, with a defined maximum impact boundary. The strongest synergistic reduction of PM2.5 and CO2 occurs at a green space rate of 85%, TE1200, and SHAPE1.2, with optimal influence boundaries of 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m, respectively. This conclusion demonstrates the key role of green space in community parks in the synergistic abatement and provides a scientific basis and practical guidance for the planning and design of urban green space under the goal of “dual-carbon”.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               The Indian agriculture sector is driven by small and marginal farmers and employs two-thirds of the Indian work force. Agriculture also accounts for around a quarter of the total greenhouse gas emissions, mainly in the form of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Hence, agriculture is an important sector for India’s transition to net-zero emissions and for the achievement of the sustainable development goals. So far, very few studies have assessed the future trajectories for CH4 and N2O emissions from the agriculture sector. Moreover, assessment of CH4 and N2O mitigation potential at a subnational (state) level is missing but is important owing to the regional diversity in India. To fill this gap, we focus on methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the agricultural activities using 23 sub-regions in India. We use the GAINS modelling framework which has been widely applied for assessing the mitigation strategies for non-CO2 emissions and multiple air pollutants at regional and global scales. We analyze a current policy and a sustainable agriculture scenario using different combinations of structural interventions and technological control measures to inform the Indian and global climate policy debates. Our results suggest that a combination of sustainable agricultural practices and maximum feasible control measures could reduce the CH4 and N2O emissions by about 6% and 19% by 2030 and 27% and 40% by 2050 when compared to the current policies scenario with limited technological interventions. At a sub-national level, highest mitigation potential is observed in Uttar Pradesh, followed by, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. The mitigation of agricultural CH4 and N2O also has co-benefits in terms of reduced local pollution, improved health, and livelihood opportunities for the local communities.",

      "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have emerged as a critical issue with profound impacts on the environment, human health, and the global economy. The steady increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, has become a major contributor to climate change and its associated catastrophic effects. To tackle this pressing challenge, a coordinated global effort is needed, which necessitates a deep understanding of emissions patterns and trends. In this paper, we explore the use of statistical modelling, specifically the lognormal distribution, as a framework for comprehending and predicting CO2 emissions. We build on prior research that suggests a complex distribution of emissions and seek to test the hypothesis that a simpler distribution can still offer meaningful insights for policy-makers. We utilize data from three comprehensive databases and analyse six candidate distributions (exponential, Fisk, gamma, lognormal, Lomax, Weibull) to identify a suitable model for global fossil CO2 emissions. Our findings highlight the adequacy of the lognormal distribution in characterizing emissions across all countries and years studied. Furthermore, to provide additional support for this distribution, we provide statistical evidence supporting the applicability of Gibrat's law to those CO2 emissions. Finally, we employ the lognormal model to predict emission parameters for the coming years and propose two policies for reducing total fossil CO2 emissions. Our research aims to provide policy-makers with accurate and detailed information to support effective climate change mitigation strategies.",

A revision of the estimated mitigation potential has implications for the feasibility of global climate policy to reach the Paris Agreement climate goals. Here, we provide a systematic bottom-up estimate of the total uncertainty in NCGG mitigation, by developing ‘optimistic’, ‘default’ and ‘pessimistic’ long-term NCGG marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves, based on a comprehensive literature review of mitigation options. The global 1.5-degree climate target is found to be out of reach under pessimistic MAC assumptions, as is the 2-degree target under high emission assumptions. In a 2-degree scenario, MAC uncertainty translates into a large projected range in relative NCGG reduction (40–58%), carbon budget (±120 Gt CO\n                    2\n                    ) and policy costs (±16%).

The economy-wide impact of mitigation covering CO2 and non-CO2 GHGs in China, has not been comprehensively studied and we develop a multi-sector dynamic model to compare the impact of CO2-only mitigation with a multi-GHG mitigation policy that also price non-CO2 GHGs. We find that the multi-GHG approach significantly reduces the marginal abatement cost and economic loss to reach the same level of GHG emissions (measures as 100 year global warming potential) compared to a CO2-only scenario. By 2060, multi-gas mitigation can reduce the tax rate by 15.44% and improve real gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.41%. The aggregate gain brought by multi-GHG mitigation are robust to various pathways and but vary across periods and sectors.",

      "abstract": "The challenging task in our ecosystem is to reduce acidic gas emissions to some extent. Many gases are emitted from the industries like H2S, CO, CO2, SO2, NO, and NO2 as exhaust gases. Among these gases, CO2, NO2, and SO2 are acidic, which results in adverse effects on humans, animals, and plants. The increase in the emission of CO2 gases from both anthropogenic and industrial sources resulted in CO2 mitigation studies. CO2 absorption studies were carried out using iron oxide nanofluid with the novel structured packed absorption column. Iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using XRD, SEM, and TEM analysis. Ammonia is used as an absorbent along with iron oxide nanofluid of three different concentrations (0.0001 w/v%, 0.001 w/v%, and 0.0015 w/v%). It was found that the iron oxide nanofluid of 0.0015 w/v% showed an improved % CO2 removal efficiency. This enhanced % CO2 removal efficiency was due to the increased interfacial area of the ameliorated contact between the liquid and gas phases. In addition, the magnetic field was introduced along with the packed column, which increased CO2 removal efficiency by 1.5%.",

The results show that, compared to other regions, achieving DLS in emerging Asian and African economies will result in more additional CO2 emissions, particularly in the DLS indicators of Mobility and Electricity. Achievement of DLS in emerging economies will result in 8.6 Gt of additional CO2 emissions, which should not jeopardize global climate targets.

We apply a time-varying difference-in-differences approach to panel data from 283 cities in China between 2003 and 2016 to analyze HSR’s carbon-mitigation effects. A causal three-path mediation model and bootstrap method are utilized to analyze how HSR contributes to CO2 mitigation. The results show that HSR operations have significant carbon-mitigation effects, especially in the eastern regions and large cities of China. Moreover, the carbon-mitigation effect of HSR tends to amplify over time. Mechanism analysis showed that HSR’s carbon-mitigation effects are realized through four pathways: transportation substitution, economic agglomeration, industrial structuring, and technological innovation, with the last one contributing the most. This paper provides practical policy recommendations for the next phase of carbon governance in China.",

      "abstract": "As the global deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology intensifies in the fight against climate change, it becomes increasingly imperative to establish robust monitoring and detection mechanisms for potential underground CO2 leakage, particularly through pre-existing or induced faults in the storage reservoir's seals. While techniques such as history matching and time-lapse seismic monitoring of CO2 storage have been used successfully in tracking the evolution of CO2 plumes in the subsurface, these methods lack principled approaches to characterize uncertainties related to the CO2 plumes' behavior. Inclusion of systematic assessment of uncertainties is essential for risk mitigation for the following reasons: (i) CO2 plume-induced changes are small and seismic data is noisy; (ii) changes between regular and irregular (e.g., caused by leakage) flow patterns are small; and (iii) the reservoir properties that control the flow are strongly heterogeneous and typically only available as distributions. To arrive at a formulation capable of inferring flow patterns for regular and irregular flow from well and seismic data, the performance of conditional normalizing flow will be analyzed on a series of carefully designed numerical experiments. While the inferences presented are preliminary in the context of an early CO2 leakage detection system, the results do indicate that inferences with conditional normalizing flows can produce high-fidelity estimates for CO2 plumes with or without leakage. We are also confident that the inferred uncertainty is reasonable because it correlates well with the observed errors. This uncertainty stems from noise in the seismic data and from the lack of precise knowledge of the reservoir's fluid flow properties.",

      "abstract": "Carbon mitigation is one challenging issue that the world is facing. To tackle deleterious impacts of CO2, processes emerged, including chemisorption from amine based solvents, and more recently physisorption in porous solids. While CO2 capture from amine is more mature, this process is corrosive and detrimental for environment. Physisorption in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is currently attracting a considerable attention, however the selection of the optimum sorbent is still challenging. While CO2 adsorption by MOFs have been widely explored from a thermodynamics standpoint, dynamical aspects remain less explored. CALF-20(Zn) MOF was recently proposed as a promising alternative to the commercially used CO2 13X zeolite sorbents, however, in-depth understanding of microscopic mechanisms originating its good performance still have to be achieved. In this report, we deliver a microscopic insight of CO2 and H2O in CALF-20(Zn) by atomistic simulations. CALF-20(Zn) revealed to exhibit unconventional guest-host behaviors that give rise to abnormal thermodynamic and diffusion. The hydrophobic nature of the solid leads to a low water adsorption enthalpy at low loading followed by a gradual increase, driven by strong water hydrogen bonds, found to arrange as quasi 1D water wires in MOF porosity, recalling water behavior in carbon nanotubes and aquaporins. While no super-diffusion found, this behavior was shown to impact diffusion along with guests loading, with a minimum correlated with inflection point of adsorption isotherm corresponding to wires formation. Interestingly, diffusion of both CO2 and H2O were also found to be of the same order of magnitude with similar non-linear behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Understanding why travel behavior differs between residents of urban centers and suburbs is key to sustainable urban planning. Especially in light of rapid urban growth, identifying housing locations that minimize travel demand and induced CO2 emissions is crucial to mitigate climate change. While the built environment plays an important role, the precise impact on travel behavior is obfuscated by residential self-selection. To address this issue, we propose a double machine learning approach to obtain unbiased, spatially-explicit estimates of the effect of the built environment on travel-related CO2 emissions for each neighborhood by controlling for residential self-selection. We examine how socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes moderate the effect and how it decomposes across the 5Ds of the built environment. Based on a case study for Berlin and the travel diaries of 32,000 residents, we find that the built environment causes household travel-related CO2 emissions to differ by a factor of almost two between central and suburban neighborhoods in Berlin. To highlight the practical importance for urban climate mitigation, we evaluate current plans for 64,000 new residential units in terms of total induced transport CO2 emissions. Our findings underscore the significance of spatially differentiated compact development to decarbonize the transport sector.",

      "abstract": "The heavy pressure to improve CO2 emission control in industry requires the identification of key sub-sectors and the clarification of how they mitigate CO2 emissions through various actions. Focusing on 30 Chinese provincial regions, this study quantifies the contribution of each industrial sector to regional CO2 mitigation by combining the logarithmic mean Divisia index with attribution analysis and extract the key sectors of CO2 mitigation for each region. Results indicate that during 2010–2019, significant emission reduction was achieved through energy intensity (74%) in Beijing, while emission reductions were attained through industrial structure changes for Anhui (50%), Henan (45%), and Chongqing (45%). The contribution to emission reduction through energy structures is not significant. The production and supply of power and heat (PSPH) is a central factor in CO2 mitigation through all three inhibitive factors. Petroleum processing and coking (PPC) generally contributes to emission reduction through energy structures, while the smelting and pressing of ferrous metals (SPMF) through changes in industrial structures and energy intensity. PSPH and SPMF, in most regions, have not achieved the emission peak. Except in the case of coal mining and dressing (CMD), CO2 emissions in other key sectors have almost been decoupled from industrial development. CMD effectively promotes CO2 mitigation in Anhui, Henan, and Hunan, with larger contribution of PPC in Tianjin, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and that of smelting and pressing of nonferrous metals in Yunnan and Guangxi. The findings help to better identify key sectors across regions that can mitigate CO2 emissions, while analyzing the critical emission characteristics of these sectors, which can provide references to formulating region- and sector-specific CO2 mitigation measures for regions at different levels of development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               A CO2-WAG (water-alternate-gas) injection EOR pilot is currently ongoing in a carbonate reservoir, in an Onshore Abu Dhabi field, as part of the company's strategy for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage. The pilot is an important phase to de-risk challenges associated with CO2 injection prior to full field implementation. This paper will focus on the mitigation of subsurface flow assurance challenges to handle corrosion, asphaltene and inorganic scaling risks in production wells.\n               As the conditions change during the CO2 pilot duration from producing dry oil to producing oil with miscible gas along with water, the flow assurance mitigation strategy must change to address the different challenges at each stage. Based on extensive lab studies and modeling work confirming the risk of corrosion, asphaltene and scale, it was decided to equip producer wells with downhole chemical injection facilities. Inhibitors for different applications were lab qualified as part of the chemical program to be injected, upon demand, during the pilot life cycle.\n               A comprehensive surveillance program of gauge cutter runs, logging and fluid sampling was put in place to monitor pilot performance and changes in fluid properties and conditions that warrant mitigation by chemicals. The plan was to inject corrosion inhibitor at the start of the pilot and switch to a corrosion/asphaltene combo chemical with CO2 break-through, as it tends to destabilize asphaltene and lead to deposition. Once water cut increases, asphaltene deposition starts to diminish and the risk of inorganic scale increases. At that stage the strategy is to switch back to corrosion inhibitor injection with scale inhibitor squeeze application into the reservoir to protect from scaling.\n               The pilot has been operational for 5 years. Water cut increased in producers from 0% to &amp;gt; 10% with instances of inorganic scale deposition in the lower part of the tubing. This was handled through acid washes due to favorable economics in comparison to inhibitor injection. CO2 levels at the producers increased from 6 mol% to 13-20 mol%, confirming CO2 break-through. With an effective corrosion inhibitor injection, the time-lapse corrosion logs confirmed that the tubing was in good condition. No asphaltene deposition experienced up to date hence no asphaltene inhibitor injection was administered.\n               This paper describes steps required to assess different flow assurance challenges during a CO2-WAG pilot and outlines the mitigation strategy including a robust surveillance program during pilot execution. This mitigation strategy should be dynamic, responding to the changes in challenges posed at each phase considering the most cost-effective solution. For scale and asphaltene deposition the frequency of occurrence should be considered to decide on whether to inject inhibitors or apply solvent soaks.",

      "abstract": "As the world pays more attention to carbon reduction, it is of great significance to identify the factors of CO2 to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals for China. Therefore, this paper explores the factors of CO2 from the perspective of CO2 mitigation potentials (CESP) and analyzes the heterogeneity of each factor. We first employ the DEA-IDA model framework to analyze the CESP and influencing factors of each region, and then use geographically and temporally weighted regress to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of influencing factors, the efficiency, coal proportion, energy intensity, per capita GDP, urbanization rate, electrification rate, trade, economic structure, and climate conditions. The research results show that: (1) for 1 unit increase in per capita CO2, the per capita CESP increases by 0.56 units. The CESP of the central and western regions is greater than that of the eastern regions, and the improvement of resource utilization efficiency can achieve the peak in advance. (2) Per capita GDP and energy intensity are the main positive factor and negative factor, respectively, and the impact of efficiency changes on CESP is mostly positive. (3) Efficiency is the most influential factor affecting the CESP; among them, a 1% increase in efficiency in Hebei can reduce the CESP of 62.47 Mt. In regions dominated by clean power, the impact of electrification rates is negative. The rest of the factors also showed spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

      "abstract": "Summary\nRemoval of lumen water by dewatering using supercritical CO2 offers an alternative method to mitigate cellular collapse in susceptible hardwoods compared to conventional timber drying methods. The anatomy of Eucalyptus nitens was quantitatively measured by light microscopy, SEM and micro-CT to provide an understanding of the mechanism of collapse during drying. These measurements were then used to recalibrate a previously developed fluid-dynamics model to predict E. nitens vessel dewatering and develop a dewatering treatment strategy for collapse mitigation. The lumens of E. nitens were from fibres (58.5% cross-section) and vessels (10.0% cross-section) with mean diameters of 8 and 142 μm, respectively. Micro-CT measurements revealed that the vessels were empty after treatment with a supercritical CO2 dewatering schedule optimised for softwood. However, the fibres remained full and this led to significant collapse during subsequent oven drying. Based on this information, a two-phase dewatering schedule was developed to include removal of fibre lumen water. Results showed that 90% of collapse could be mitigated to a change in external volume of only 3.9% provided the green moisture content was lowered to 70% before oven drying. The predicted effective diffusion coefficient of CO2 in E. nitens was comparable to Pinus radiata and they showed similar anatomical tortuosity and porosity resistance in their hydrofluidic networks. Collapse mitigation using supercritical CO2 could be combined with extraction of desirable sap components, post-dewatering drying, preservative treatment, and mechanical forming. These processes may be achieved in a single supercritical plant and apply to most anatomically similar hardwoods.",

      "abstract": "The increasing trend in global energy demand has led to an extensive use of fossil fuels and subsequently in a marked increase in atmospheric CO2 content, which is the main culprit for the greenhouse effect. In order to successfully reverse this trend, many schemes for CO2 mitigation have been proposed, taking into consideration that large-scale decarbonization is still infeasible. At the same time, the projected increase in the share of variable renewables in the future energy mix will necessitate large-scale curtailment of excess energy. Collectively, the above crucial problems can be addressed by the general scheme of CO2 hydrogenation. This refers to the conversion of both captured CO2 and green H2 produced by RES-powered water electrolysis for the production of added-value chemicals and fuels, which are a great alternative to CO2 sequestration and the use of green H2 as a standalone fuel. Indeed, direct utilization of both CO2 and H2 via CO2 hydrogenation offers, on the one hand, the advantage of CO2 valorization instead of its permanent storage, and the direct transformation of otherwise curtailed excess electricity to stable and reliable carriers such as methane and methanol on the other, thereby bypassing the inherent complexities associated with the transformation towards a H2-based economy. In light of the above, herein an overview of the two main CO2 abatement schemes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), is firstly presented, focusing on the route of CO2 hydrogenation by green electrolytic hydrogen. Next, the integration of large-scale RES-based H2 production with CO2 capture units on-site industrial point sources for the production of added-value chemicals and energy carriers is contextualized and highlighted. In this regard, a specific reference is made to the so-called Power-to-X schemes, exemplified by the production of synthetic natural gas via the Power-to-Gas route. Lastly, several outlooks towards the future of CO2 hydrogenation are presented.",

Based on analyzing the industrial activity level, technological progress, raw material substitution, and CO\n                    2\n                    recycling ratio from the cement, aluminum, ammonia, steel, lime, and ferroalloy industries, this paper considers three scenarios, namely, national determined contribution (NDC), carbon mitigation scenario (CMS), and deep mitigation scenario (DMS), and systematically explores the CO\n                    2\n                    emissions from future industrial processes as well as relevant cumulative emissions, emission sources, mitigation potentials, and mitigation sources in China. The results demonstrate that CO\n                    2\n                    emissions of the six main industrial processes can be continuously and significantly reduced in China. In the scenarios, compared with the 2020 level (1448 million metric tons of CO\n                    2\n                    ), the CO\n                    2\n                    emissions can be reduced by 71%, 82%, and 94%, respectively, in 2060, mainly owing to the reduction of the activity level, the adjustment of the product structure and the application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) under the DMS scenario. This paper provides several major policy implications to reduce the CO\n                    2\n                    emissions through adjusting the industrial structure and current lifestyles, improving the durability of industrial products and the management and technical levels, increasing the substitution ratio of low‐carbon raw materials in industrial production, supporting innovative low‐carbon technologies, the establishment and operation of the carbon market and carbon pricing mechanism, and further promoting the current “leader” system of energy‐intensive industries.",

      "abstract": "One of society’s major current challenges is carbon dioxide emissions and their consequences. In this context, new technologies for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture have attracted much attention. One of these is carbon capture and utilization (CCU). This work focuses on the latest trends in a holistic approach to carbon dioxide capture and utilization. Absorption, adsorption, membranes, and chemical looping are considered for CO2 capture. Each CO2 capture technology is described, and its benefits and drawbacks are discussed. For the use of carbon dioxide, various possible applications of CCU are described, starting with the utilization of carbon dioxide in agriculture and proceeding to the conversion of CO2 into fuels (catalytic processes), chemicals (photocatalytic processes), polymers, and building supplies. For decades, carbon dioxide has been used in industrial processes, such as CO2-enhanced oil recovery, the food industry, organic compound production (such as urea), water treatment, and, therefore, the production of flame retardants and coolants. There also are several new CO2-utilization technologies at various stages of development and exploitation, such as electrochemical conversion to fuels, CO2-enhanced oil recovery, and supercritical CO2. At the end of this review, future opportunities are discussed regarding machine learning (ML) and life cycle assessment (LCA).",

Here we incorporate the latest global non-CO2emissions and mitigation data into a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model GCAM and examine 90 mitigation scenarios pairing different levels of CO2and non-CO2GHG abatement pathways. We estimate that when non-CO2mitigation contributions are not fully implemented, the timing of net-zero CO2must occur about two decades earlier. Conversely, comprehensive GHG abatement that fully integrates non-CO2mitigation measures in addition to a net-zero CO2commitment can help achieve 1.5 °C stabilization. While decarbonization-driven fuel switching mainly reduces non-CO2emissions from fuel extraction and end use, targeted non-CO2mitigation measures can significantly reduce fluorinated gas emissions from industrial processes and cooling sectors. Our integrated modeling provides direct insights in how system-wide all GHG mitigation can affect the timing of net-zero CO2for 1.5 °C and 2 °C climate change scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissions—largely methane and nitrous oxide—could play a significant role in climate change mitigation. However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH4), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO2-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO2-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe oil industry needs to reduce CO2 emissions across the entire lifecycle of fossil fuels to meet environmental regulations and societal requirements and to sustain its business. With this goal in mind, this study aims to evaluate the CO2 mitigation potential of several bio‐oil co‐processing pathways in an oil refinery. Techno‐economic analysis was conducted on different pathways and their greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potentials were compared. Thirteen pathways with different bio‐oils, including vegetable oil (VO), fast pyrolysis oil (FPO), hydro‐deoxygenated oil (HDO), catalytic pyrolysis oil (CPO), hydrothermal liquefaction oil (HTLO), and Fischer–Tropsch fuels, were analyzed. However, no single pathway could be presented as the best option. This would depend on the criteria used and the target of the co‐processing route. The results obtained indicated that up to 15% of the fossil‐fuel output in the refinery could be replaced by biofuel without major changes in the core activities of the refinery. The consequent reduction in CO2 emissions varied from 33% to 84% when compared with pure equivalent fossil fuels replaced (i.e., gasoline and diesel). Meanwhile, the production costs varied from 17 to 31€/GJ (i.e., 118–213$/bbleq). Co‐processing with VO resulted in the lowest overall performance among the options that were evaluated while co‐processing HTLO in the hydrotreatment unit and FPO in the fluid catalytic cracking unit showed the highest potential for CO2 avoidance (69% of refinery CO2 emissions) and reduction in CO2 emissions (84% compared to fossil fuel), respectively. The cost of CO2 emissions avoided for all of the assessed routes was in the range of €99–651 per tCO2. © 2020 The Authors.

      "abstract": "A climate change mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases. Mitigation can mean using new technologies and renewable energies, making older equipment more energy efficient, or changing management practices or consumer behavior. The mitigation technologies are able to reduce or absorb the greenhouse gases (GHG) and, in particular, the CO2 present in the atmosphere. The CO2 is a persistent atmospheric gas. It seems increasingly likely that concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will overshoot the 450 ppm CO2 target, widely seen as the upper limit of concentrations consistent with limiting the increase in global mean temperature from pre-industrial levels to around 2 °C. In order to stay well below to the 2 °C temperature thus compared to the pre-industrial level as required to the Paris Agreement it is necessary that in the future we will obtain a low (or better zero) emissions and it is also necessary that we will absorb a quantity of CO2 from the atmosphere, by 2070, equal to 10 Gt/y. In order to obtain this last point, so in order to absorb an amount of CO2 equal to about 10 Gt/y, it is necessary the implementation of the negative emission technologies. The negative emission technologies are technologies able to absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere. The aim of this work is to perform a detailed overview of the main mitigation technologies possibilities currently developed and, in particular, an analysis of an emergent negative emission technology: the microalgae massive cultivation for CO2 biofixation.",

The reason is that, so far, still few scientists have deeply analyzed this underlying impact, especially from the income levels’ perspective.\n               \n               \n                  Design/methodology/approach\n                  The study divides the BRI region into four groups by the income levels (high, HI; upper middle, UM; lower middle, LM; lower, LO) during 1992–2014 and uses the logarithmic mean Divisia index.\n               \n               \n                  Findings\n                  The results show the REC of the BRI has an overall decreasing trend but the driving contribution to the CO2 growth except that the HI group’s REC has an obviously mitigating contribution of −2.09%. The number indicates that it is necessary and urgent to exploit and use renewable energy, especially in mid- and low-income countries due to the large potential of carbon mitigation. Besides, during 2010–2014, the energy intensity effects of different groups were negative except for the low income group (positive, 5.47 million tonnes), which showed that some poor countries recently reduced CO2 emissions only by extensively using renewable energy but not enhancing the corresponding efficiency. Conversely, in other rich countries, people paid more attention to improve the energy-use efficiency to lower energy intensity.\n               \n               \n                  Originality/value\n                  This study creatively analyzes this underlying impact of the REC to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the income levels’ perspective and proposes some reasonable countermeasures of reducing CO2 for the BRI region.",
