      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Greenhouse gas emissions are abundantly produced every year by human activities. They are the main cause of global warming and the changes observed in the climate. In this study, we used the microwave plasma torch system (MPT) to drive the conversion of CO2 through the Boudouard reaction pathway. The necessary microwave power applied has efficiently activated the coal used as a reductant agent to initiate the chemical decomposition of CO2. The specific energy consumption reached 94 kJ/mol to ensure the continuous decomposition process of carbon dioxide under microwave plasma torch technology at atmospheric pressure. Experimentally, the conversion rate of 20 lpm of CO2 under the MPT developed in this research reached 64% at a moderate temperature of 680°C with a specific recipe composed of the operating conditions coupled to the geometry of the designed reactor. In addition, the numerical model built in Aspen Plus V12 supported the experimental results by producing similar patterns in the conversion of CO2 as a function of microwave power. Thus, the entire process tends to be energy-saving and an efficient solution for greenhouse gas mitigation for a clean and sustainable environment. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of energy, economic, and environmental policies on Türkiye’s energy dynamics and CO2 emissions using climate models and an agent-based simulation (ABM) framework. By integrating climate projections with policy scenarios, it assesses how energy transitions and climate change affect renewable energy sources (RES), cooling demands, and CO2 emissions from electricity generation. Methods include selecting suitable Global Climate Models (GCMs), evaluating climate change impacts on RES performance, and simulating policy effects through ABM across one base and nine policy scenarios from 2023 to 2040. The study highlights the critical role of policy interventions in influencing emissions trends and energy prices. It identifies renewable energy subsidies and low-carbon strategies, such as nuclear power support, as effective tools for reducing emissions and stabilizing energy costs. The methodologies and findings provide actionable insights for policymakers globally, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate data with policy planning.",

      "abstract": "Carbon Dioxide Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) is a well-established technology that has been deployed for over 2 decades, primarily to boost oil recovery rates. Recently, however, CO2-EOR has gained attention as a potential carbon mitigation strategy, given its ability to both enhance oil recovery without requiring extensive new drilling and store CO2 in subsurface formations. This dual function aligns with net-zero carbon goals, as CO2 is partly trapped in the reservoir through solubility and hysteresis effects on relative permeability. The performance of CO2-EOR, in terms of both oil recovery and CO2 storage potential, depends on numerous factors, including reservoir properties such as porosity, permeability, thickness, fluid composition, and operating conditions like bottom-hole pressure and injection rates. Traditional screening for CO2-EOR candidate reservoirs typically relies on experimental work, simulation studies, and field analogs, all of which require significant time and resources. However, a large dataset exists from prior CO2-EOR projects, which could enable more efficient screening.To leverage this data and capitalize on recent advancements in artificial intelligence, we developed an integrated methodology to predict CO2-EOR production profiles rapidly and accurately. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), we trained a proxy model (PM) with over 2,000 simulation cases based on real-world CO2-EOR projects. The model’s novelty lies in its ability to generate dimensionless type curves and their derivatives, which can be matched with production data to estimate average reservoir characteristics at later project stages.Our results demonstrate that the proxy model achieves a high level of accuracy, with a maximum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.012 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99 between predicted and simulated results across three output variables. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis revealed the significant influence of parameters such as fluid composition, rock-fluid interaction, porosity, permeability, and initial reservoir pressure on CO2-EOR production profiles. This approach provides a rapid, cost-effective alternative to conventional methods, allowing for quicker and more informed decision-making in CO2-EOR projects.",

      "abstract": "Harnessing inexhaustible solar energy for CO2 valorization is  substantial step toward achieving  carbon-neutral energy cycle. However, CO2 conversion often exhibits slow kinetics, necessitating the utilization of sacrificial agents making the process economically unfeasible. In the ongoing quest for sustainable and economically feasible CO2 valorization, herein the photoreduction of CO2 to CO coupled with biomass-based alcohol oxidation to fine chemicals is reported via Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 (BWO/g-CN) 2D-2D nanosheet based S-scheme heterojunction. Importantly, BWO/g-CN-60 exhibits highest photocatalytic activity with CO production rate of 6.87 mmol g-1 h-1, accompanied by >98% selectivity and selective oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde, with notable yield of 42% in 6 h under simulated solar light. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 14.3% is achieved for CO production at the wavelength of 420 nm. Additionally, the formed heterostructure results in enhanced charge separation and accelerated charge transfer kinetics as validated by PL, EIS, and photocurrent studies. EPR, 13CO2 labeling, DFT studies, and various controlled experiments provided  deeper insight into the mechanism of underlying photo-redox process. Thus, the current study presents a sustainable paradigm for CO2 mitigation by converting it into solar fuel, while synergistically producing the fine chemicals through effectively harnessing the full potential of charge carriers.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTPrivate and voluntary initiatives, such as voluntary carbon markets, can support public policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture. This study investigates the impact of behavioural factors (reluctance to change) and social dynamics (peer imitation) on the adoption of two mitigation practices on Swiss dairy and beef farms: the use of the feed additive 3‐nitrooxypropanol (3‐NOP), the commercial product Bovaer and substituting concentrate feeds with on‐farm cultivated legumes. Using a bio‐economic agent‐based model and a diverse sample of farms, we simulated outcomes for reducing GHG emissions under increasing levels of financial compensation in scenarios reflecting behavioural and social influences. The results show that, assuming profit‐maximising behaviour, emissions could be reduced by up to 24% at a price of 150 CHF per tonne of CO2‐equivalent. However, when farmers' reluctance to change is considered, the mitigation potential decreases significantly. Introducing social network effects, such as peer imitation, improves outcomes, increasing the potential reduction and showing that social influence can help overcome behavioural resistance. These findings suggest that, although private and voluntary schemes offer meaningful potential for reducing agricultural emissions, their effectiveness is limited when real‐world behavioural dynamics are considered. The study highlights the importance of aligning voluntary market mechanisms with supportive public policies to maximise GHG reductions.",

      "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges that could potentially threaten ecosystems, human populations, and weather patterns over time. Impacts including rising sea levels and soil salinization are caused by climate change, primarily driven by human activities such as fossil fuel combustion for energy production. The resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, amplify the greenhouse effect and accelerate global warming, underscoring the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies. This study investigates the performance and outcomes of various machine learning regression models for predicting CO2 emissions. A comprehensive overview of performance metrics, including R2, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root-mean-squared error, and cross-validation scores for decision tree, random forest, multiple linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, gradient boosting, and support vector regression models was conducted. The biggest source of CO2 emissions was coal (46.11%), followed by natural gas (25.49%) and electricity (26.70%). Random forest and gradient boosting both performed well, but multiple linear regression had the highest prediction accuracy among machine learning models (R2 = 0.98 training, 0.99 testing). Support vector regression (SVR) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) demonstrated lower accuracies, whereas decision tree displayed overfitting. The decision tree, random forest, multiple linear regression, and gradient boosting models were found to be extremely sensitive to coal, natural gas, and petroleum (transportation sector) based on sensitivity analysis. Random forest and gradient boosting demonstrated the most sensitivity to coal usage, whereas KNN and SVR maintained excellent R2 scores (0.94–0.98) but were less susceptible to changes in the variables. This analysis provides insights into the agreement and discrepancies between predicted and actual CO2 emissions, highlighting the models’ effectiveness and potential limitations.",

      "abstract": "Against the backdrop of China’s “dual carbon” strategy, investigating the carbon emission characteristics and low-carbon operational status of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across regions is pivotal for achieving synergistic pollution reduction and carbon mitigation. Leveraging 2024 operational data from 98 WWTPs in eastern China—encompassing treatment volume, energy consumption, sludge production, and chemical dosages—this study refined the Assessment Standard for Carbon Mitigation in Municipal WWTPs and Technical Specification for Low-Carbon Operation of WWTPs. A novel carbon accounting framework and low-carbon performance evaluation system were subsequently developed to analyze the impacts of treatment scale, technological configuration, and load rate on carbon footprints. Key findings revealed an average carbon intensity of 0.399 kg CO2-eq/m3 for the region, with small-scale facilities (0.582 kg CO2-eq/m3) exhibiting significantly higher emissions compared to their large-scale counterparts (0.392 kg CO2-eq/m3). Indirect emissions constituted 62.1% of the total footprint, while chemical dosing contributed 14.2%, primarily driven by carbon sources and phosphorus removal agents. Fossil-derived CO2 accounted for 4.6% of emissions. Notably, the AAO process demonstrated the lowest carbon intensity (0.370 kg CO2-eq/m3), whereas SBR systems registered the highest (0.617 kg CO2-eq/m3). Furthermore, 25% of the assessed facilities were classified as high-emission plants. Strategic recommendations are proposed, including prioritizing AAO process optimization, implementing intelligent chemical dosing control, utilizing food wastewater as an alternative carbon source, and enhancing operational load rates, to advance synergistic environmental and carbon mitigation goals in eastern China’s wastewater sector.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTCO2‐based polyols represent a significant advancement in carbon capture and utilization technologies, offering an innovative solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while producing value‐added polymeric materials. This study investigates their synthesis using double metal cyanide (DMC) catalysts and their application in rigid polyurethane foams (RPUFs). To address challenges in conventional CO2 incorporation, novel initiators, including pentaerythritol propoxylate (PE‐PO) and pentaerythritol ethoxylate (PE‐EO), are evaluated. DMC catalysts are synthesized with tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) as a complexing agent. Among the tested initiators, PE‐PO demonstrated the highest efficiency, achieving a CO2 incorporation of 20.4 mol% at an optimal monomer‐to‐initiator molar ratio of 50. The resulting CO2‐based polyols are effectively utilized in RPUFs, which exhibit enhanced mechanical properties, uniform cell morphology, and stable thermal performance. The enhanced mechanical properties of the RPUFs correlate with an increase in carbonate linkages within the polymer backbone, leading to greater intermolecular interactions and improved structural integrity, as confirmed by FT‐IR and compression tests. Beyond enhancing material performance, this approach contributes to sustainability by replacing conventional petroleum‐based polyols. This work introduces a novel strategy for CO2 integration into polyols, advancing the sustainable synthesis of high‐performance RPUFs. The findings highlight the potential of novel initiators and DMC catalysts to overcome existing limitations, representing a significant step forward in eco‐friendly polymer development.\nimage",

      "doi": "10.3390/catal15010094",
      "abstract": "As a promising member of the carbon nitride family, nitrogen-rich g-C3N5 has attracted significant attention because of its excellent light absorption performance. Nevertheless, its practical application in photocatalytic CO2 reduction is hindered by severe photogenerated charge recombination and limited CO2 adsorption capacity. Constructing a heterojunction has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate charge recombination, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst. Herein, a series of CdS/g-C3N5-X heterojunction catalysts were prepared via an in situ hydrothermal approach. The obtained heterojunction catalysts exhibited a novel coral reef-like morphology which facilitated the exposure of additional active sites, thereby enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO2. Moreover, studies have shown that CdS can be anchored to the surface of g-C3N5 through C-S bonds, forming a built-in electric field at the interface, which accelerated the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. Consequently, the resulting heterojunction materials demonstrated high efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with H2O as a sacrificial agent. In particular, CdS/g-C3N5-0.2 exhibited the maximum photocatalytic performance up to 22.9 μmol·g−1·h−1, which was 6 times and 3 times that of unmodified g-C3N5 and CdS, respectively. The results indicated that the increased active sites and enhanced charge separation of the Cd/g-C3N5-0.2 catalyst were the primary reasons for its improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. This work provides a novel heterojunction-based photocatalyst for efficient CO2 photocatalytic reduction, offering insights into the preparation of high-performance photocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.",

      "abstract": "The application of carbon-rich char-based admixtures, including biochar and plastic char, in construction products has received substantial attention from global industries due to their potential to “lock in” carbon for the long term, thus mitigating the climatic impacts of future constructions. Furthermore, a sharp rise in plastic waste generation and uncontrolled landfilling threatens natural ecosystems. Depending on type, plastic waste can be used as fuel, and the generated char (solid residue) can be reintegrated into the construction value chain by utilizing it as a carbon-sequestering admixture in construction materials. This article discusses critical factors, including the synthesis temperature, heating rate, and different activation pathways, for tuning plastic char’s porosity and surface properties, contributing to enhanced carbon fixation and CO2 uptake. Chemical pyrolysis using alkaline agents produces microporous structure (< 2 nm) with high surface areas (> 1000 m2g−1) and CO2 uptake, ranging up to 4.6 mmolg−1 while acidic agents produce a higher fraction of mesopores (> 2 nm) with lower surface areas < 1500 m2g−1 and CO2 uptake capacities (up to 1.8 mmolg−1). The review finds that surface functionalization of plastic char and altering its physicochemical properties improve the engineering properties of construction binders. The locked carbon in the char, complemented by additional CO2 uptake in the engineered pore and surface sites, can be instrumental in mitigating the embodied carbon of construction products. However, future investigations should study the microstructural interactions of engineered char within construction binders and conduct a holistic life-cycle assessment to fully realize the benefits of using engineered plastic char as a supplementary additive.",

      "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in geological reservoirs faces viscous fingering, gravity override, and poor mobility control due to its low viscosity and resulting inefficient distribution and compromised storage capacity. Therefore, an urgent need arises to thicken the CO2 and enhance its viscosity for better mobility control and uniform distribution across the reservoir. This study examines the different schemes to enhance sweep efficiency in subsurface storage. In the context of polymer-, surfactant-, and foam-based technologies, the study defines optimization for CO2 injection and retention. Sweep efficiency is critical in maximizing reservoir usage and minimizing the risk of leakage by ensuring even dispersion of CO2. Polymers could increase CO2 viscosity, thereby yielding better mobility control and wider reservoir coverage. Surfactants reduce interfacial tension, enabling CO2 to invade less permeable areas, while foams act as conformance control agents, changing the flow path of CO2 away from the high permeability and into the underused areas. The study further includes advanced materials like CO2-soluble polymers, fluorinated surfactants, and nanoparticle-stabilized foams with superior stability under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions typical of deep reservoirs. Though effective, these approaches are challenged with chemical degradation, economic feasibility and environmental consequences. The study delves into these limitations and suggests integrated approaches involving polymers, and surfactant foams for enhanced sweep efficiency. These findings are a step towards realizing surfactant efficient and sustainable carbon sequestration technologies and contribute to the efforts of the world to mitigate climate change.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of the human population and industrialization has intensified anthropogenic activities, leading to the release of various toxic chemicals into the environment, triggering significant risks to human health and ecosystem stability. One sustainable solution to remove toxic chemicals from various environmental matrices, such as water, air, and soil, is bioremediation, an approach utilizing biological agents. Microalgae, as the primary producers of the aquatic environment, offer a versatile bioremediation platform, where their metabolic processes break down and convert pollutants into less harmful substances, thereby mitigating the negative ecological impact. Besides the CO2 sequestration potential, microalgae are a source of renewable energy and numerous high-value biomolecules. Additionally, microalgae can mitigate various toxic chemicals through biosorption, bioaccumulation, and biodegradation. These remediation strategies propose a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to address environmental pollution. This review evaluates the microalgal mitigation of major environmental contaminants—heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), persistent organic pollutants (POPs), flue gases, microplastics, and nanoplastics—linking specific microalgae removal mechanisms to pollutant-induced cellular responses. Each section explicitly addresses the effects of these pollutants on microalgae, microalgal bioremediation potential, bioaccumulation process, the risks of trophic transfer, and biomagnification in the food web. Herein, we highlight the current status of the microalgae-based bioremediation prospects, pollutant-induced microalgal toxicity, bioaccumulation, and consequential biomagnification. The novelty of this review lies in integrating biomagnification risks with the bioremediation potential of microalgae, providing a comprehensive perspective not yet addressed in the existing literature. Finally, we identify major research gaps and outline prospective strategies to optimize microalgal bioremediation while minimizing the unintended trophic transfer risks.",

      "doi": null,
      "abstract": "Hallucinations remain a significant challenge in current Generative AI models, undermining trust in AI systems and their reliability. This study investigates how orchestrating multiple specialized Artificial Intelligent Agents can help mitigate such hallucinations, with a focus on systems leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to facilitate seamless agent interactions. To achieve this, we design a pipeline that introduces over three hundred prompts, purposefully crafted to induce hallucinations, into a front-end agent. The outputs are then systematically reviewed and refined by second- and third-level agents, each employing distinct large language models and tailored strategies to detect unverified claims, incorporate explicit disclaimers, and clarify speculative content. Additionally, we introduce a set of novel Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) specifically designed to evaluate hallucination score levels. A dedicated fourth-level AI agent is employed to evaluate these KPIs, providing detailed assessments and ensuring accurate quantification of shifts in hallucination-related behaviors. A core component of this investigation is the use of the OVON (Open Voice Network) framework, which relies on universal NLP-based interfaces to transfer contextual information among agents. Through structured JSON messages, each agent communicates its assessment of the hallucination likelihood and the reasons underlying questionable content, thereby enabling the subsequent stage to refine the text without losing context. The results demonstrate that employing multiple specialized agents capable of interoperating with each other through NLP-based agentic frameworks can yield promising outcomes in hallucination mitigation, ultimately bolstering trust within the AI community.",
