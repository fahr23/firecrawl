**Abstract:**

> Carbon Dioxide Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) is a well-established technology that has been deployed for over 2 decades, primarily to boost oil recovery rates. Recently, however, CO2-EOR has gained attention as a potential carbon mitigation strategy, given its ability to both enhance oil recovery without requiring extensive new drilling and store CO2 in subsurface formations. This dual function aligns with net-zero carbon goals, as CO2 is partly trapped in the reservoir through solubility and ...
