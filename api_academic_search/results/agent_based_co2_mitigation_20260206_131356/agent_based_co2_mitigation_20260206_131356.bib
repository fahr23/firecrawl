  abstract = {ABSTRACT Greenhouse gas emissions are abundantly produced every year by human activities. They are the main cause of global warming and the changes observed in the climate. In this study, we used the microwave plasma torch system (MPT) to drive the conversion of CO2 through the Boudouard reaction pathway. The necessary microwave power applied has efficiently activated the coal used as a reductant agent to initiate the chemical decomposition of CO2. The specific energy consumption reached 94 kJ/m},
