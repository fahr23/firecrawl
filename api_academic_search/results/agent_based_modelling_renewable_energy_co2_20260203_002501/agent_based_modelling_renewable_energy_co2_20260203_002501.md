### 1. Malaysia’s Electricity Decarbonisation Pathways: Exploring the Role of Renewable Energy Policies Using Agent-Based Modelling
<a name='article-1'></a>

**Authors:** Babatunde K.A.
**Year:** 2023
**Journal:** Energies
**DOI:** [10.3390/en16041720](https://doi.org/10.3390/en16041720)
**URL:** [https://doi.org/10.3390/en16041720](https://doi.org/10.3390/en16041720)
**Source:** Scopus API

**Abstract:**

> Coal’s rising prominence in the power industry has raised concerns about future CO2 emissions and energy reliability. As of 2017, it is estimated that Malaysia’s existing natural gas production can only be maintained for another 40 years. Consequently, the carbon intensity of electricity production has increased due to the increasing share of coal-fired plants and electricity infrastructure inefficiencies. To summarise, energy industries have been the highest emitters of CO2 emissions, with a 54...

**Abstract:**

> The transition process towards renewable energy systems is facing challenges in both fluctuating electricity generation of photovoltaic and wind power as well as socio-economic disruptions. With regard to sector integration, solutions need to be developed, especially for the mobility and the industry sector, because their ad hoc electrification and decarbonization seem to be unfeasible. Power-to-fuel (P2F) technologies may contribute to bridge the gap, as renewable energy can be transferred into...

**Abstract:**

> An agent-based modeling framework is developed and employed to replicate the interactions among urban farms. The objectives are to efficiently manage an urban farm’s food, energy, and water resources, decrease food waste, and increase the food availability for the local community. A case study of eleven farms was investigated in Vancouver, Canada to study the linkages between the resources in the urban food, energy, and water nexus. Each urban farm in the simulation belonged to a community micro...
