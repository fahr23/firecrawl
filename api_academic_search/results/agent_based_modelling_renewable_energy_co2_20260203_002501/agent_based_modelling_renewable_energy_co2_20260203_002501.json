      "abstract": "Coal’s rising prominence in the power industry has raised concerns about future CO2 emissions and energy reliability. As of 2017, it is estimated that Malaysia’s existing natural gas production can only be maintained for another 40 years. Consequently, the carbon intensity of electricity production has increased due to the increasing share of coal-fired plants and electricity infrastructure inefficiencies. To summarise, energy industries have been the highest emitters of CO2 emissions, with a 54-percent share. In response to these challenges, the government implemented a series of renewable energy (RE) policy measures. Whether these policies are sufficient in driving Malaysian energy decarbonisation is yet to be seen. In this study, we simulated different scenarios from 2015 to 2050 with an agent-based model to explore the roles of renewable energy policies towards emission reduction in the energy sector. The simulation results reveal that when all renewables initiatives were implemented, the share of RE increased to 16 percent, and emissions intensity fell by 26 percent relative to its level in 2005, albeit with increasing absolute carbon emissions. This milestone is still far below the government’s 45 percent reduction target. The simulation results demonstrate that renewable energy policies are less effective in driving Malaysian electricity towards desired low-carbon pathways. Furthermore, it is evidenced that no single approach can achieve the emission reduction target. Therefore, a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy policy measures is unavoidable to decarbonise the electricity sector in Malaysia.",

      "abstract": "The transition process towards renewable energy systems is facing challenges in both fluctuating electricity generation of photovoltaic and wind power as well as socio-economic disruptions. With regard to sector integration, solutions need to be developed, especially for the mobility and the industry sector, because their ad hoc electrification and decarbonization seem to be unfeasible. Power-to-fuel (P2F) technologies may contribute to bridge the gap, as renewable energy can be transferred into hydrogen and hydrocarbon-based synthetic fuels. However, the renewable fuels production is far from economically competitive with conventional fuels. With a newly developed agent-based model, potential developments in the German energy markets were simulated for a horizon of 20 years from 2016 to 2035. The model was constructed through a participatory modeling process with relevant actors and stakeholders in the field. Model findings suggest that adjusted regulatory framework conditions (e.g., exemptions from electricity surtaxes, accurate prices for CO2-certificates, strong start-up subsidies, and drastic emission reduction quotas) are key factors for economically feasible P2F installations and will contribute to its large-scale integration into the German energy system. While plant capacities do not exceed 0.042 GW in a business-as-usual scenarios, the above-mentioned adjustments lead to plant capacities of at least 3.25 GW in 2035 with concurrent reduction in product prices.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of energy, economic, and environmental policies on Türkiye’s energy dynamics and CO2 emissions using climate models and an agent-based simulation (ABM) framework. By integrating climate projections with policy scenarios, it assesses how energy transitions and climate change affect renewable energy sources (RES), cooling demands, and CO2 emissions from electricity generation. Methods include selecting suitable Global Climate Models (GCMs), evaluating climate change impacts on RES performance, and simulating policy effects through ABM across one base and nine policy scenarios from 2023 to 2040. The study highlights the critical role of policy interventions in influencing emissions trends and energy prices. It identifies renewable energy subsidies and low-carbon strategies, such as nuclear power support, as effective tools for reducing emissions and stabilizing energy costs. The methodologies and findings provide actionable insights for policymakers globally, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate data with policy planning.",

      "abstract": "An agent-based modeling framework is developed and employed to replicate the interactions among urban farms. The objectives are to efficiently manage an urban farm’s food, energy, and water resources, decrease food waste, and increase the food availability for the local community. A case study of eleven farms was investigated in Vancouver, Canada to study the linkages between the resources in the urban food, energy, and water nexus. Each urban farm in the simulation belonged to a community microgrid generating electricity from solar and wind. The local farms aimed to provide fresh produce for their respective local communities. However, at some points, they lacked supply, and at other points, there was excess supply, leading to food waste. Food waste can be converted into fertilizers or bioenergy. However, an alternative solution must be employed due to the natural resources required for production, efficiently managing resources, and adhering to sustainability guidelines. In this paper, an optimization framework was integrated within the agent-based model to create a micro supply chain. The supply chain directly linked the producers with the consumers by severing the links involved in a traditional food supply. Each urban farm in the study collaborated to reduce food wastage and meet consumer demands, establishing farmer-to-farmer exchange in transitional agriculture. The optimization-based micro supply chain aimed to minimize costs and meet the equilibrium between food supply and demand. Regular communication between the farms reduced food waste by 96.9% over 16 weeks. As a result, the fresh food availability increased for the local community, as exemplified by the consumer purchases over the same period. Moreover, the simulation results indicated that the renewable energy generation at the community microgrids aided in the generation of 22,774 Mwh from solar and 2568 Mwh from wind. This has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions in areas that heavily rely on non-renewable energy sources.",

      "abstract": "Energy production and consumption are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHG), along with industry, and is one of the highest causes of global warming. Forecasting the environmental cost of energy production is necessary for better decision making and easing the switch to cleaner energy systems in order to reduce air pollution. This paper describes a hybrid approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an agent-based architecture for forecasting carbon dioxide (CO2) issued from different energy sources in the city of Annaba using real data. The system consists of multiple autonomous agents, divided into two types: firstly, forecasting agents, which forecast the production of a particular type of energy using the ANN models; secondly, core agents that perform other essential functionalities such as calculating the equivalent CO2 emissions and controlling the simulation. The development is based on Algerian gas and electricity data provided by the national energy company. The simulation consists firstly of forecasting energy production using the forecasting agents and calculating the equivalent emitted CO2. Secondly, a dedicated agent calculates the total CO2 emitted from all the available sources. It then computes the benefits of using renewable energy sources as an alternative way to meet the electric load in terms of emission mitigation and economizing natural gas consumption. The forecasting models showed satisfying results, and the simulation scenario showed that using renewable energy can help reduce the emissions by 369 tons of CO2 (3%) per day.",

      "abstract": "The depletion of fossil-based fuels, fluctuating fuel market, and environmental deterioration demand an aggressive approach towards the advancement of renewable energy technologies. By the time reliable technology for a clean and abundant energy supply is established, existing sources must be economized. Biomass gasification is the way forward in that direction. CFD modeling shows promise in the development of advanced gasification systems. A simplified 3D CFD model of a downdraft gasifier is developed to investigate the effect of gasifying agent composition on the quality of syngas. Simulation results are compared with published experimental data and found to be in reasonably good agreement. Mixing CO2 with a gasification agent is also investigated as a possible carbon capture and utilization (CCU) strategy. An air-steam mixture is used as a base-case gasification agent. Firstly, the effect of air-to-steam ratio on syngas composition is investigated. Secondly, the effect of oxygen and mixing CO2 with a gasification agent is investigated in two separate cases. A 50%-50% air-steam mixture is found to produce the best quality syngas. Oxygen is found to have a negligible impact on the quality of syngas. The air-steam-CO2 = 23%-50%-15% mixture is found to be optimum regarding syngas quality.",

      "abstract": "Today’s electrical energy landscape is characterized by new challenges such \n as deregulation, liberalization of energy markets, increased competition, \n growing demands on security of supply, price insecurities, and demand to cut \n CO2 emissions. All mentioned challenges are calling for consideration of \n various options (like nuclear, coal, gas or renewable scenarios) and for \n better understanding of energy systems modelling in order to optimize proper \n energy mix. Existing models are not sufficient any more and planners will \n need to think differently in order to face these challenges. European \n emission trading scheme (EU ETS) started in 2005 and it has great influence \n on power system short term and long term planning. Croatia is obliged to \n establish a national scheme for trading of greenhouse gas emission allowances \n from the year 2010, which will be focused on monitoring and reporting only \n until accession to EU when it will be linked with EU ETS. Thus, for Croatian \n power system it is very important to analyze possible impacts of CO2 \n emissions. Analysis presented in this paper was done by two different models: \n mathematical model, based on short run marginal costs (SRMC, relevant for \n fuel switch in existing power plant and merit order change) and long run \n marginal costs (LRMC, relevant for new investment decisions); and electricity \n market simulation model PLEXOS, which was used for modelling Croatian power \n system during development of the Croatian energy strategy in 2008. Results of \n the analysis show important impacts that emission trading has on Croatian \n power system, such as influence of emission price rise on price of \n electricity and on emission quantity, and changes in power plants output that \n appear with emission price rise. Breakeven point after which gas power plant \n becomes more competitive than coal is 62 €/tCO2 for SRMC and 40 €/tCO2 for \n LRMC. With CO2 prices above 31 €/tCO2 wind is more competitive than gas or \n coal, which emphasizes importance that emission price has on competitiveness \n of renewables.",
