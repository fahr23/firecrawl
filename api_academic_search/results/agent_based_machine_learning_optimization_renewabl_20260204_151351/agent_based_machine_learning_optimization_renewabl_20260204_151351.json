      "abstract": "The transition of Türkiye’s energy market toward net-zero emissions by 2053 requires modeling approaches capable of capturing complex interactions and long-term uncertainties. In this study, a long-term agent-based modeling (ABM) framework was developed, integrating econometric demand forecasting with a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and machine learning (ML)-based day-ahead market (DAM) price prediction. Of the ML models tested, CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest, and supported investment analysis through net present value (NPV) calculations. The framework represents major market actors—including generation units, investors, and the market operator—while also incorporating the impact of Türkiye’s first nuclear power plant (NPP) under construction and the potential introduction of a carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS). All model components were validated against historical data, confirming robust forecasting and market replication performance. Hourly simulations were conducted until 2053 under alternative policy and demand scenarios. The results show that renewable generation expands steadily, led by onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV), while nuclear capacity, ETS implementation, and demand assumptions significantly reshape prices, generation mix, and carbon emissions. The nuclear plant lowers market prices, whereas an ETS substantially raises them, with both policies contributing to emission reductions. These scenario results were connected to actionable policy recommendations, outlining how renewable expansion, ETS design, nuclear development, and energy efficiency measures can jointly support Türkiye’s 2053 net-zero target. The proposed framework provides an ex-ante decision-support framework for policymakers, investors, and market participants, with future extensions that can include other energy markets, storage integration, and enriched scenario design.",

      "abstract": "The increasing development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems add to the environmental impact concerns. Machine learning training requires huge amounts of energy for training large-scale models, particularly deep learning networks in a data center which is in most cases built by non-renewable energy sources. As AI applications expand, their energy demands grow, exacerbating their contribution to global carbon emissions and climate change. Several approaches (such as optimized algorithms, energy-efficient hardware, renewable energy infrastructure, green data centers, and advanced cooling techniques) have emerged to mitigate the carbon footprint associated with the AI development pipeline. This chapter proposes a novel algorithm carbon-aware pso-based hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that incorporates a dual-objective function, where the aim is to maximize model accuracy while minimizing carbon emissions. Unlike traditional HPO methods, the proposed algorithm integrates early stopping to cut off unnecessary computation which significantly reduces training time with less energy consumption. The algorithm is executed on energy-efficient hardware configurations, including CPUs and GPUs, to leverage hardware-specific advantages and optimize resource usage. The algorithm balances both software-level optimizations like early stopping and hardware acceleration in showing an approach toward making ML eco-friendly, thus meeting the needs for both model performance and environmental efficiency. This approach addresses the dual challenges of high model performance and environmental impact, contributing to a sustainable future in the AI development scenario. This algorithm holds immense potential for future deployment in renewable energy infrastructure cloud platforms to achieve significant carbon reduction and adopt an eco-friendly environment. This alignment with renewable energy infrastructures represents a transformative step toward reducing AI's environmental impact and achieving long-term goals for sustainable technological innovation.",

      "abstract": "Multigeneration systems (MGS) with integrated hydrogen (H\n                    2\n                    ) production are emerging as vital solutions for meeting global energy demands while addressing environmental sustainability. This review presents the first comprehensive evaluation of MGS with integrated H\n                    2\n                    production driven by diverse energy sources, including solar, geothermal (Geo), biomass (BM), biogas (BG), natural gas (NG), and waste heat (WH). Through an in‐depth analysis of 143 peer‐reviewed papers, we assess the performance of these systems based on thermoeconomic, environmental, and sustainability metrics. Our findings reveal that hybrid systems, particularly those combining renewable and nonrenewable sources, stand out for their superior performance. Hybrid configurations utilizing solar and NG with advanced cycles like supercritical CO\n                    2\n                    (sCO\n                    2\n                    ) achieve the highest overall efficiency, up to 90%, and exergy efficiencies exceeding 70%. In addition, hybrid systems demonstrate remarkable H\n                    2\n                    production capacities, with solar–NG systems generating up to 50 MW of power and producing 20 tons of H\n                    2\n                    per day, while reducing CO\n                    2\n                    emissions to as low as 0.2 kgCO\n                    2\n                    e/kW h. Optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), improve system performance by up to 20%, while machine learning (ML) enhances operational efficiency and predictive accuracy in real‐time applications. This review also highlights the trade‐off between system complexity and efficiency, where more intricate configurations, such as those involving multiple energy inputs and advanced thermodynamic cycles, deliver higher performance at the cost of increased system complexity. Our analysis provides novel insights and offers a road map for future research, confirming the critical role of MGS in achieving global decarbonization targets through cost‐effective H\n                    2\n                    production and optimized performance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               The modern era has witnessed a surge in energy consumption and its dependence on fossil fuels, which are harmful to the environment, prompting researchers to examine techniques for regulating energy usage in buildings, specifically with regard to residential electricity consumption. The pursuit of net-zero energy consumption and low carbon emission buildings is a significant undertaking that nations across the globe are actively endeavoring to accomplish. In order to accomplish this goal, the structure in question must efficiently oversee its overall energy usage while concurrently capitalizing on sustainable energy sources. The precise estimation of future electricity usage in buildings is an essential element in the process of energy efficiency planning and optimization. The present study introduces a soft computing methodology and data decomposition as approaches for evaluating the energy usage of residential structures. An innovative machine learning approach is introduced for the purpose of estimating the initial cost required to construct a green structure that consumes no net energy. By utilizing wavelet decomposition, it is possible to determine how to transform the structure into one that is intelligent and energy efficient. Following wavelet parallel converter analysis, the data were processed with an estimator model based on an ideal neural network. The results indicate that the mean estimation errors for recurrent neural network, Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA), and gene expression programming (GEP) were reduced by 72%, 65%, and 77%, respectively, using this method. Conversely, when the proposed methodology is applied to the smart management of building energy consumption, the examined structures experience an average reduction of 8% in energy consumption. Moreover, the outcomes of CO2 gas emissions demonstrate that the suggested model possesses the capability to accurately forecast CO2 emissions. The study highlights the necessity of employing innovative techniques such as machine learning to decrease building energy usage and CO2 emissions. The discovery of these results can assist policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector in advancing the adoption of smart building technologies.",

      "abstract": "We have analyzed 127 publications for this review paper, which discuss applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in marketing, robotics, gaming, automated cars, natural language processing (NLP), internet of things security, recommendation systems, finance, and energy management. The optimization of energy use is critical in today’s environment. We mainly focus on the RL application for energy management. Traditional rule-based systems have a set of predefined rules. As a result, they may become rigid and unable to adjust to changing situations or unforeseen events. RL can overcome these drawbacks. RL learns by exploring the environment randomly and based on experience, it continues to expand its knowledge. Many researchers are working on RL-based energy management systems (EMS). RL is utilized in energy applications such as optimizing energy use in smart buildings, hybrid automobiles, smart grids, and managing renewable energy resources. RL-based energy management in renewable energy contributes to achieving net zero carbon emissions and a sustainable environment. In the context of energy management technology, RL can be utilized to optimize the regulation of energy systems, such as building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, to reduce energy consumption while maintaining a comfortable atmosphere. EMS can be accomplished by teaching an RL agent to make judgments based on sensor data, such as temperature and occupancy, to modify the HVAC system settings. RL has proven beneficial in lowering energy usage in buildings and is an active research area in smart buildings. RL can be used to optimize energy management in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) by learning an optimal control policy to maximize battery life and fuel efficiency. RL has acquired a remarkable position in robotics, automated cars, and gaming applications. The majority of security-related applications operate in a simulated environment. The RL-based recommender systems provide good suggestions accuracy and diversity. This article assists the novice in comprehending the foundations of reinforcement learning and its applications.",

      "abstract": "Energy efficiency is a key to reduced carbon footprint, savings on energy bills, and sustainability for future generations. For instance, in hot climate countries such as Qatar, buildings are high energy consumers due to air conditioning that resulted from high temperatures and humidity. Optimizing the building energy management system will reduce unnecessary energy consumptions, improve indoor environmental conditions, maximize building occupant’s comfort, and limit building greenhouse gas emissions. However, lowering energy consumption cannot be done despite the occupants’ comfort. Solutions must take into account these tradeoffs. Conventional Building Energy Management methods suffer from a high dimensional and complex control environment. In recent years, the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, applying neural networks for function approximation, shows promising results in handling such complex problems. In this work, a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent is proposed for controlling and optimizing a school building’s energy consumption. It is designed to search for optimal policies to minimize energy consumption, maintain thermal comfort, and reduce indoor contaminant levels in a challenging 21-zone environment. First, the agent is trained with the baseline in a supervised learning framework. After cloning the baseline strategy, the agent learns with proximal policy optimization in an actor-critic framework. The performance is evaluated on a school model simulated environment considering thermal comfort, CO2 levels, and energy consumption. The proposed methodology can achieve a 21% reduction in energy consumption, a 44% better thermal comfort, and healthier CO2 concentrations over a one-year simulation, with reduced training time thanks to the integration of the behavior cloning learning technique.",
