  abstract = {The transition of Türkiye’s energy market toward net-zero emissions by 2053 requires modeling approaches capable of capturing complex interactions and long-term uncertainties. In this study, a long-term agent-based modeling (ABM) framework was developed, integrating econometric demand forecasting with a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and machine learning (ML)-based day-ahead market (DAM) price prediction. Of the ML models tested, CatBoost achieved the highest ac},
