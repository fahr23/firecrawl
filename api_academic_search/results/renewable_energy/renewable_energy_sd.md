**Abstract:**
> Marine renewable energies are promising enablers of a cleaner energy future. Some technologies, like wind, are maturing and have already achieved commercial success. Similar to their terrestrial counterparts, marine renewable energy systems require energy storage capabilities to achieve the flexibility of the 21st century grid demand. The unique difficulties imposed by a harsh marine environment challenge the unencumbered rise of marine renewable energy generation and storage systems. In this study, the fundamentals of marine renewable energy generation technologies are briefed. A comprehensive review and comparison of state-of-the-art novel marine renewable energy storage technologies, including pumped hydro storage (PHS), compressed air energy storage (CAES), battery energy storage (BES), hydrogen energy storage (HES), gravity energy storage (GES), and buoyancy energy storage (ByES), are conducted. The pros and cons, and potential applications, of various marine renewable energy storage technologies are also compiled. Finally, several future trends of marine renewable energy storage technologies are connoted.

### 2. Carbon reduction, ‘the public’ and renewable energy: engaging with socio‐technical configurations 🔵

**Abstract:**
> In the context of challenging targets for renewable energy generation, this paper draws out social implications of moves towards low carbon energy systems. As renewable energy develops as a heterogeneous category, many potential forms of social relation between ‘publics’ and technologies are emerging. Utilising perspectives from science and technology studies, we outline five modes in which renewable energy has been implemented in the UK and how these involve different configurations of technology and social organisation. We argue that a multiplicity of roles for ‘the public’ are implicated across this increasingly complex landscape, cutting across established categories and raising questions of meaning, differentiation, interrelation and access. Policy assumptions and conceptions are questioned, highlighting that dominant characterisations of public roles have been part of a concentration on particular socio‐technical pathways to the exclusion of others.

**Abstract:**
> As conventional energy resources dry up and pollution increases, utility companies and policy makers seek to develop new energy programs that are more environmentally sound and replenishable. Renewable energy has emerged as an alternative energy resource, but its marketing has not been successful despite widespread consumer concern about the environment. Using the theory of reasoned action as a theoretical framework, the current research investigates the relationship of three variables (concern with the environment, knowledge about renewable energy, and beliefs about salient consequences of using renewable energy) with consumer attitude toward paying a premium for renewable energy. As predicted by the theory of reasoned action, a positive relationship between beliefs about salient consequences and attitudes toward paying more for renewable energy was found. Overall concern levels were quite high for consumers in the sample, whereas knowledge levels were relatively low. Interestingly, it was found that consumer concern failed to translate into heightened knowledge about renewable energy. The study suggests that the consumer's environmental concern and beliefs about renewable energy to date are more emotionally charged than fact- or knowledge-based. Implications for marketing strategies and consumer education are provided. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

### 4. Consumption‐based carbon emissions, renewable energy consumption, financial development and economic growth in Chile 🔵

**URL:** [https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2945](https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.2945)

**Authors:** Derviş Kırıkkaleli, Hasan Güngör, Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo

**Year:** 2021

**Journal:** Business Strategy and the Environment

**Abstract:**
> Abstract This paper aims to investigate the effect of financial development and renewable energy consumption on consumption‐based CO 2 emissions in Chile while controlling for economic growth and electricity consumption. Based on the aim of the paper, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds with Kripfganz and Schneider's (2018) approximations, fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), and gradual shift causality tests are applied in this study. The outcomes clearly reveal that while financial development and renewable energy consumption reduce the consumption‐based CO 2 emissions in Chile, economic growth and electricity consumption increase consumption‐based carbon emissions. The gradual shift causality test provides consistent results with ARDL, FMOLS, and DOLS estimators. Therefore, policymakers in Chile should dynamically encourage the research and development of low‐carbon technologies and renewable energy investments while imported nonrenewable energy sources level should be targeted, and especially those sectors which are more energy‐intensive and causing to increase in consumption‐based CO 2 emissions.

**Journal:** Sustainable Development

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The present study aims to explore the long‐run and causal effect of financial development and renewable energy consumption on environmental sustainability while controlling technological innovation and economic growth within the global framework. In line with the aim of the study, the fully modified OLS (FMOLS), dynamic OLS (DOLS), canonical cointegrating regression (CCR), Bayer and Hanck cointegration, and frequency‐domain causality tests are employed. Empirical evidence confirms the existence of a long‐run linkage among the variables. The present study also finds that in the long run, global financial development and global renewable energy consumption have a long‐run significant positive effect on environmental sustainability, while economic growth increases carbon emission flaring around the world. Within the global framework, the study, therefore, recommends that in order to increase environmental quality, global policy‐makers should further consider the roles of renewable energy and financial development by implementing reform energy policies in both developed and developing countries.

**Journal:** Sustainable Development

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Countries enact environmental regulations to achieve sustainable development and ecological sustainability. However, environmental regulations do not guarantee environmental sustainability unless implemented efficiently. Furthermore, political institutions play a key role in the formulation and management of environmental regulations. This research examines the relationship between democracy, environmental regulations, economic growth, and ecological footprint (EF) in the panel of G7 nations from 1985 to 2017. Second generation econometric techniques are used to analyze the data. The empirical evidence indicates that economic growth enhances EF while democracy and environmental regulations positively contribute to ecological sustainability by reducing EF. The causal outcomes reveal that democracy Granger causes EF and renewable energy indicating that democracy curbs environmental degradation and stimulates the share of renewables. Further, democracy and environmental regulations Granger cause each other. Lastly, the implication of these findings for sustainable development and ecological sustainability are discussed.

**Year:** 2020

**Journal:** Angewandte Chemie International Edition

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The use of renewable energy by means of electrochemical techniques by converting H 2 O, CO 2 and N 2 into chemical energy sources and raw materials, is the basis for securing a future sustainable “green” energy supply. Some weaknesses and inconsistencies in the practice of determining the electrocatalytic performance, which prevents a rational bottom‐up catalyst design, are discussed. Large discrepancies in material properties as well as in electrocatalytic activity and stability become obvious when materials are tested under the conditions of their intended use as opposed to the usual laboratory conditions. They advocate for uniform activity/stability correlations under application‐relevant conditions, and the need for a clear representation of electrocatalytic performance by contextualization in terms of functional investigation or progress towards application is emphasized.

### 8. How renewable energy consumption lower global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? Evidence from countries with different income levels 🔵

**Journal:** World Economy

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Significant difference in the emission–renewables nexus across countries with different income levels is frequently ignored in previous studies. To empirically investigate whether the effect of renewable energy consumption on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions differs across countries with different income levels, the emission–growth–renewables nexus for a global panel of 120 countries and four income‐based subpanels over the period 1995–2015 is examined. Fully considering the potential cross‐sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity, a series of econometric techniques allowing for cross‐sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity is utilised. Cross‐sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity are confirmed for the global panel as well as for all four subpanels. Only for the global panel, high‐income subpanel and upper‐middle‐income subpanel is the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis valid. Renewable energy consumption has a negative effect on CO 2 emissions, but its effect is not significant; the mitigation effect may be obscured by higher economic growth and increasing non‐renewable energy consumption. The global panel and four subpanels provide mixed directionality of causality among the variables, suggesting that for various income‐based subpanels, significant differences exist in the effect of renewable energy consumption on CO 2 emissions, especially highlighting in various direct and indirect influencing paths between renewable energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.

**Journal:** Advanced Energy Materials

**Abstract:**
> An enormous research effort is currently being directed towards the development of efficient visible‐light‐driven photocatalysts for renewable energy applications including water splitting, CO 2 reduction and alcohol photoreforming. Layered double hydroxide (LDH)‐based photocatalysts have emerged as one of the most promising candidates to replace TiO 2 ‐based photocatalysts for these reactions , owing to their unique layered structure, compositional flexibility, controllable particle size, low manufacturing cost and ease of synthesis. By introducing defects into LDH materials through the control of their size to the nanoscale, the atomic structure, surface defect concentration, and electronic and optical characteristics of LDH materials can be strategically engineered for particular applications. Furthermore, through the use of advanced characterization techniques such as X‐ray absorption fine structure, positron annihilation spectrometry, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, density‐functional theory calculations, and photocatalytic tests, structure‐activity relationships can be established and used in the rational design of high‐performance LDH‐based photocatalysts for efficient solar energy capture. LDHs thus represent a versatile platform for semiconductor photocatalyst development with application potential across the energy sector.

**Journal:** International Journal of Energy Research

**Abstract:**
> In the modern world, only conventional energy resources cannot fulfil the growing energy demand. Electricity is a fundamental building block of a technological revolution. Today, most of the electricity demand is met by the burning of fossil fuels but at the cost of adverse environmental impact. In order to bridge the gap between electricity demand and supply, nonconventional and eco-friendly means of energy generation are considered. Renewable energy systems (RESs) offer an adequate solution to mitigate the challenges originated due to greenhouse gasses (GHG). However, they have an unpredictable power generation with specific site requirements. Grid integration of RESs may lead to new challenges related to power quality, reliability, power system stability, harmonics, subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs), power quality, and reactive power compensation. The integration with energy storage systems (ESSs) can reduce these complexities that arise due to the intermittent nature of RESs. In this paper, a comprehensive review of renewable energy sources has been presented. Application of ESSs in RESs and their development phase has been discussed. Role of ESSs in increasing lifetime, efficiency, and energy density of power system having RESs has been reviewed. Moreover, different techniques to solve the critical issues like low efficiency, harmonics, and inertia reduction in photovoltaic (PV) systems have been presented. Unlike most of the available review papers, this article also investigates the impact of FACTS technology in RESs-based power system using multitype flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controllers. Three simulation models have been developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that FACTS devices help to maintain the stability of RESs integrated power system. This review paper is believed to be of potential benefit for researchers from both the industry and academia to develop better understanding of challenges and solution techniques for REs-based power systems and future research dimensions in this area.

**Abstract:**
> Summary 1. The evidence for anthropogenically induced climate change is overwhelming with the production of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels being a key driver. In response, many governments have initiated programmes of energy production from renewable sources. 2. The marine environment presents a relatively untapped energy source and offshore installations are likely to produce a significant proportion of future energy production. Wind power is the most advanced, with development of wave and tidal energy conversion devices expected to increase worldwide in the near future. 3. Concerns over the potential impacts on biodiversity of marine renewable energy installations (MREI) include: habitat loss, collision risks, noise and electromagnetic fields. These factors have been posited as having potentially important negative environmental impacts. 4. Conversely, we suggest that if appropriately managed and designed, MREI may increase local biodiversity and potentially benefit the wider marine environment. Installations have the capacity to act as both artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices, which have been used previously to facilitate restoration of damaged ecosystems, and de facto marine‐protected areas, which have proven successful in enhancing both biodiversity and fisheries. 5. The deployment of MREI has the potential to cause conflict among interest groups including energy companies, the fishing sector and environmental groups. Conflicts should be minimized by integrating key stakeholders into the design, siting, construction and operational phases of the installations, and by providing clear evidence of their potential environmental benefits. 6. Synthesis and applications. MREI have the potential to be both detrimental and beneficial to the environment but the evidence base remains limited. To allow for full biodiversity impacts to be assessed, there exists an urgent need for additional multi and inter‐disciplinary research in this area ranging from engineering to policy. Whilst there are a number of factors to be considered, one of the key decisions facing current policy makers is where installations should be sited, and, dependent upon site, whether they should be designed to either minimize negative environmental impacts or as facilitators of ecosystem restoration.

### 12. Measuring the impact of renewable energy, public health expenditure, logistics, and environmental performance on sustainable economic growth 🔵

**Journal:** Sustainable Development

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The study aims to examine the potential relationship between public health expenditures, logistics performance indices, renewable energy, and ecological sustainability in Association of Southeast Asian Nations member countries. The study used secondary data, which downloaded from the World Bank website and tested for hypotheses using the structural equation modeling. The results show that the use of renewable energy in logistics operations will improve environmental and economic performance to reduce emissions, whereas environmental performance is negatively correlated with public health expenditures, indicating that greater environmental sustainability can improve human health and economic growth. The results also show that increased public health spending and poor environmental performance undermine economic growth in low efficiency and low labor productivity, thus reducing the speed of economic activity. On the other hand, the use of renewable energy in logistics cannot only improve the sustainability of the environment but also create a better national image and provide better export opportunities in environmentally friendly countries to promote sustainable economic growth. The outcomes of this study will help the policy/decision makers to make the proper planning to their investments for achieving sustainable economic growth.

### 13. Offshore renewable energy: ecological implications of generating electricity in the coastal zone 🔵

**URL:** [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01060.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01060.x)

**Authors:** Andrew B. Gill

**Year:** 2005

**Journal:** Journal of Applied Ecology

**Abstract:**
> Summary Global‐scale environmental degradation and its links with non‐renewable fossil fuels have led to an increasing interest in generating electricity from renewable energy resources. Much of this interest centres on offshore renewable energy developments (ORED). The large scale of proposed ORED will add to the existing human pressures on coastal ecosystems, therefore any ecological costs and benefits must be determined. The current pressures on coastal ecology set the context within which the potential impacts (both positive and negative) of offshore renewable energy generation are discussed. The number of published peer‐review articles relating to renewable energy has increased dramatically since 1991. Significantly, only a small proportion of these articles relate to environmental impacts and none considers coastal ecology. Actual or potential environmental impact can occur during construction, operation and/or decommissioning of ORED. Construction and decommissioning are likely to cause significant physical disturbance to the local environment. There are both short‐ and long‐term implications for the local biological communities. The significance of any effects is likely to depend on the natural disturbance regime and the stability and resilience of the communities. During day‐to‐day operation, underwater noise, emission of electromagnetic fields and collision or avoidance with the energy structures represent further potential impacts on coastal species, particularly large predators. The wider ecological implications of any direct and indirect effects are discussed. Synthesis and applications . This review demonstrates that offshore renewable energy developments will have direct and, potentially, indirect consequences for coastal ecology, with these effects occurring at different scales. Ecologists should be involved throughout all the phases of an ORED to ensure that appropriate assessments of the interaction of single and multiple developments with the coastal environment are undertaken.

**Journal:** Global Change Biology

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is fundamental for halting anthropogenic climate change. However, renewable energy facilities can be land‐use intensive and impact conservation areas, and little attention has been given to whether the aggregated effect of energy transitions poses a substantial threat to global biodiversity. Here, we assess the extent of current and likely future renewable energy infrastructure associated with onshore wind, hydropower and solar photovoltaic generation, within three important conservation areas: protected areas (PAs), Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and Earth's remaining wilderness. We identified 2,206 fully operational renewable energy facilities within the boundaries of these conservation areas, with another 922 facilities under development. Combined, these facilities span and are degrading 886 PAs, 749 KBAs and 40 distinct wilderness areas. Two trends are particularly concerning. First, while the majority of historical overlap occurs in Western Europe, the renewable electricity facilities under development increasingly overlap with conservation areas in Southeast Asia, a globally important region for biodiversity. Second, this next wave of renewable energy infrastructure represents a ~30% increase in the number of PAs and KBAs impacted and could increase the number of compromised wilderness areas by ~60%. If the world continues to rapidly transition towards renewable energy these areas will face increasing pressure to allow infrastructure expansion. Coordinated planning of renewable energy expansion and biodiversity conservation is essential to avoid conflicts that compromise their respective objectives.

**Abstract:**
> It is believed that fossil fuel sources are exhaustible and also the major cause of greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, it is required to increase the portion of renewable energy sources in supplying the primary energy of the world. In this study, it is focused on application of nanotechnology in exploitation of renewable energy sources and the related technologies such as hydrogen production, solar cell, geothermal, and biofuel. Here, nanotechnologies influence on providing an alternative energy sources, which are environmentally benign, are comprehensively discussed and reviewed. Based on the literature, employing nanotechnology enhances the heat transfer rate in photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems and modifies PV structures, which can improve its performance, making fuel cells much cost-effective and improving the performance of biofuel industry through utilization of nanocatalysts, manufacturing materials with high durability and lower weight for wind energy industry.

**DOI:** 10.1002/er.2882

**Authors:** İbrahim Dinçer, Calin Zamfirescu

**Year:** 2012

**Journal:** International Journal of Energy Research

**Abstract:**
> This article develops the concept of renewable-energy-based multigeneration options for producing a number of outputs, such as power, heat, hot water, cooling, hydrogen, fresh water, and so forth; and discusses their benefits. Such multigeneration options obviously lead to improved system performance and reduced environmental impacts. First, single-generation (power generation only) and cogeneration systems are compared with respect to the energy utilization efficiency, exergy efficiency, green house gases (GHG) mitigation, and payback period. It is found that the cogeneration increases GHG mitigation about 2 to 4 times, whereas the payback time decreases about 2.8 times with respect to the single-generation case. Exergy efficiency is found to be between about 55% and 65%, depending on the degree of cogeneration. The exergy efficiency shows the maximum values for certain source temperatures. For the case studied here, the optimum source temperature is taken as 200°C for analysis purposes. The results show that multigeneration of energy systems helps increase both energy and exergy efficiencies, reduce cost and environmental impact, and increase sustainability.

**Journal:** International Journal of Energy Research

**Abstract:**
> As the world faces serious energy challenges, the development and implementation of renewable energy technologies become increasingly important. In this article, we offer a glimpse of the role nanotechnology, in particular, innovations of nanostructures and nanomaterials, is playing in the development of selected renewable energy technologies. These technologies, based on the authors' research interests, include (1) converting the energy of sunlight directly into electricity using solar cells; (2) converting solar energy into hydrogen fuel by splitting water into its constituents; (3) storing hydrogen in solid-state forms; and (4) utilizing hydrogen to generate electricity through the use of fuel cells. It is clear that nanotechnology-enabled renewable energy technologies are starting to scale up dramatically. As they become mature and cost effective in the decades to come, renewable energy could eventually replace the traditional, environmentally unfriendly, fossil fuels.

### 18. The future of forecasting for renewable energy 🔵

**Journal:** Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews Energy and Environment

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Forecasting for wind and solar renewable energy is becoming more important as the amount of energy generated from these sources increases. Forecast skill is improving, but so too is the way forecasts are being used. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the state‐of‐the‐art of forecasting wind and solar energy. We describe approaches in statistical and physical modeling for time scales from minutes to days ahead, for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting. Our focus changes then to consider the future of forecasting for renewable energy. We discuss recent advances which show potential for great improvement in forecast skill. Beyond the forecast itself, we consider new products which will be required to aid decision making subject to risk constraints. Future forecast products will need to include probabilistic information, but deliver it in a way tailored to the end user and their specific decision making problems. Businesses operating in this sector may see a change in business models as more people compete in this space, with different combinations of skills, data and modeling being required for different products. The transaction of data itself may change with the adoption of blockchain technology, which could allow providers and end users to interact in a trusted, yet decentralized way. Finally, we discuss new industry requirements and challenges for scenarios with high amounts of renewable energy. New forecasting products have the potential to model the impact of renewables on the power system, and aid dispatch tools in guaranteeing system security.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Under the growing threats of climate change, innovation and pollution reduction have become driving forces for cleaner economic growth and the environment. This study endeavors to analyze the effect of economic complexity—understood as structural transformation toward more sophisticated and knowledge‐based production, economic progress, renewable energy consumption, and population growth over carbon emissions. Our study employs panel data for a sample of 28 OECD countries covering the period of 1990–2014. The main contribution to the energy economics literature is given by bringing together the concept of environmental degradation and economic complexity controlling via renewable energy consumption and economic and population growth. Based on the extensive empirical analysis (augmented mean group estimator, panel cointegration, and panel regression techniques), we conclude that economic complexity and renewable energy might help in mitigating the environmental degradation problems in OECD countries.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract This study develops a theoretical framework to quantify the impacts of technological progress, renewable energy consumption and international trade on carbon emissions (CO 2 ), unlike many other studies that consider variables of interest in an ad hoc manner. The developed framework is then applied to the data from the BRICS countries for 1990–2017 period. The study also takes into consideration the integration, co‐integration, as well as cross‐country interdependence and heterogeneity properties of the panel data, and hence, the obtained results are robust and policy insights are well‐grounded. We estimate that technological progress, renewable energy consumption, and export size contribute to the reduction of the CO 2 emissions, while gross domestic product (GDP) and import size increase the pollution both in the long‐ and short‐run. Our main policy recommendations would be the implementations of the measures, regulations, and establishment of the legislative frameworks that foster the technological enhancements and transition toward sustainable energy.
