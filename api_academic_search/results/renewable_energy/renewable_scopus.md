**Abstract:**
> Abstract About two thirds of global greenhouse emissions is caused by burning of fossil fuels for energy purposes and this has spurred great research interest to develop renewable energy technologies based on wind, solar power, and so on. Redox flow batteries (RFB) are receiving wide attention as scalable energy‐storage systems to address the intermittency issues of renewable energy sources. However, for widespread commercialization, the redox flow batteries should be economically viable and environmentally friendly. Zinc based batteries are good choice for energy storage devices because zinc is earth abundant and zinc metal has a moderate specific capacity of 820 mA hg −1 and high volumetric capacity of 5851 mA h cm −3 . We herein report a zinc‐iron (Zn‐Fe) hybrid RFB employing Zn/Zn(II) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couples as positive and negative redox systems, respectively, separated by a self‐made anion exchange membrane (AEM). The battery delivers a good discharge voltage of approximately 1.34 V at 25 mA cm −2 , with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 92%, voltage efficiency (VE) of 85% and energy efficiency (EE) of ~78% for 30 charge‐discharge cycles. Repeated galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles show no degradation in performance, confirming the excellent stability of the system. A key advancement in the present Zn‐Fe hybrid redox flow battery with AEM separator is that no dendrite growth was observed on zinc electrode on repeated charge‐discharge cycles, which was the serious drawback of many previously reported zinc based redox flow batteries.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Renewable energy sources (RES), such as photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines have been widely applied as alternative energy solutions to address the global environmental concern and satisfy the energy demand. The large‐scale amalgamation of intermittent RES causes reliability and stability distress in the electric grid. To mitigate the nature of fluctuation from RES, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is considered one of the utmost effective and efficient arrangements which can enhance the operational flexibility of the power system. This article provides a comprehensive review to point out various applications of BESS technology in reducing the adverse impacts of PV and wind integrated systems. The key focus is given to battery connection techniques, power conversion system, individual PV/wind, and hybrid system configuration. The application of BESS is categorized into three areas, active, reactive, and active‐reactive power features. The key findings of the existing research of BESS application are summarized and discussed along with several simulation results. By taking a thorough review, this article identifies the key challenges of BESS application including battery charging/discharging strategy, battery connection, power conversion efficiency, power converter, RES forecast, and battery lifetime and suggests future research directions that could be explored during the design, operation, and implementation of BESS technology in the power system.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The all‐vanadium redox flow battery is a promising technology for large‐scale renewable and grid energy storage, but is limited by the low energy density and poor stability of the vanadium electrolyte solutions. A new vanadium redox flow battery with a significant improvement over the current technology is reported in this paper. This battery uses sulfate‐chloride mixed electrolytes, which are capable of dissolving 2.5 M vanadium, representing about a 70% increase in energy capacity over the current sulfate system. More importantly, the new electrolyte remains stable over a wide temperature range of −5 to 50 °C, potentially eliminating the need for electrolyte temperature control in practical applications. This development would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of energy storage, thus accelerating its market penetration.

**Abstract:**
> Renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power are widely used; however, their intermittent nature impairs power supply quality by creating frequency distortions and irregularities in voltage. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are utilized to flatten out and relieve fluctuation issues. To prevent the need for larger storage systems and to prolong their operational life through controlled charging and discharging, a method of control for BESS charging level regulation is necessary. This study presents a solar-wind power and battery state of charge (SoC) control technique using a hydrogen electrolyzer (HE) fuel cell unit. An Intelligent Model Predictive Controller (IMPC) has been developed that utilizes a neural network (NN) plant model for predictive minimization instead of using a mathematical plant model for dynamic management of the HE output, which allows for flattened PV-wind power supply with regulated BESS charging and discharging. The IMPC accepts as inputs the intermittent renewable power and different battery attributes and intelligently manages the HE production while staying within the imposed restrictions. The NN, as opposed to a mathematical plant model, captures the dynamics of the plant with exceptionally high accuracy. Moreover, the NN plant model performance increases as the data gathered from the actual system increases. The neural network model resolves concerns with the MPC model’s mathematical intricacy that occurs as the plant becomes more complicated. According to simulation results, the IMPC greatly reduces PV-wind power fluctuations, for solar power, the IMPC reduces the peak battery SoC by 26.7% and compared to FLC, the peak SoC is reduced by 11.2%. Similarly, for wind power, the peak SoC is reduced by 7.3% and is decreased 3.2% more than the FLC. To demonstrate the power smoothing effectiveness of the IMPC, the peak solar power ramp rate is reduced by 30.3% and the peak wind power ramp rate is reduced by 91.3%. The presented method encourages green hydrogen usage in the electrical sector for supplying firmed solar and wind power.

**Journal:** International Journal of Energy Research

**Abstract:**
> To make manufacturing systems more energy cost-efficient, significant research proposes adopting energy--aware production scheduling with on-site renewable energy generation systems and battery energy storage systems. Depending on the different system configurations and various practical scenarios, the effect of those proposals would vary on energy efficiency and time-related performance of the system because of the complex dynamics and trade-offs in the manufacturing process. This paper proposes a mathematical optimization-based systematic approach to comprehensively evaluate and analyze the effect on energy cost and makespan by energy-aware production scheduling, on-site solar power generation, and battery energy storage in various configurations. Numerical experiments are designed to demonstrate how the presented optimization models can be used to investigate the cost-saving and performance degradation that results from different configurations. Based on our numerical experiment, using only energy-aware scheduling can reduce the energy cost by 23% and the total cost by 7%. Simultaneous use of all three efforts saves 36% of energy cost and 15% of the total cost, which comprises the energy and time-related makespan costs. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the practical benefits of renewable energy generation and battery energy storage under different generation and storage capacities.

**Year:** 2011

**Journal:** International Journal of Energy Research

**Abstract:**
> The commercial development and current economic incentives associated with energy storage using redox flow batteries (RFBs) are summarised. The analysis is focused on the all-vanadium system, which is the most studied and widely commercialised RFB. The recent expiry of key patents relating to the electrochemistry of this battery has contributed to significant levels of commercialisation in, for example, Austria, China and Thailand, as well as pilot-scale developments in many countries. The potential benefits of increasing battery-based energy storage for electricity grid load levelling and MW-scale wind/solar photovoltaic-based power generation are now being realised at an increasing level. Commercial systems are being applied to distributed systems utilising kW-scale renewable energy flows. Factors limiting the uptake of all-vanadium (and other) redox flow batteries include a comparatively high overall internal costs of $217?kW?1?h?1 and the high cost of stored electricity of ? $0.10?kW?1?h?1. There is also a low-level utility scale acceptance of energy storage solutions and a general lack of battery-specific policy-led incentives, even though the environmental impact of RFBs coupled to renewable energy sources is favourable, especially in comparison to natural gas- and diesel-fuelled spinning reserves. Together with the technological and policy aspects associated with flow batteries, recent attempts to model redox flow batteries are considered. The issues that have been addressed using modelling together with the current and future requirements of modelling are outlined.

**Journal:** International Journal of Energy Research

**Abstract:**
> Optimal operation of micro grids (MGs) with high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has become inflexible as a consequence of the uncertainty and intermittency nature of RESs. Energy management along with battery energy storage system (BESS) is thus essential to minimize these uncertainties of MGs and to ensure continuity of energy supply and maintain the reliability of the system. In this paper, a dual-stage MG optimal energy management approach considering the BESS model and other dispatchable resources is introduced to minimize the operating cost. The proposed approach comprises of the schedule and dispatch stages. The mixed-integer linear programming is applied to solve the dual-stage energy management problem and the performance of the suggested technique is compared with the particle swarm optimization technique. The obtained results prove that the incorporation of the suggested BESS plant can significantly reduce the operating costs up to 7% and 6% when committed to supplying power in the scheduling and dispatch stages. The results also show that power loss has a considerable impact on MG energy management. The optimal simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed microgrid energy resources optimization strategy.

**Abstract:**
> The sustainable use of energy is one of the main challenges currently. The increase in the use of renewable energies must also be accompanied by storage systems that respect the environment or are as harmless as possible. In this work, life‐cycle assessment (LCA) “from cradle to gate” and a preliminary cost assessment of two types of redox flow batteries, such as vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) and zinc/cerium batteries (ZCBs), are studied. Ecoinvent 3.3 data base, AWARE, and CML Baseline v3.04 methodologies are used to quantify the environmental burden into 12 midpoint impact categories (water footprint, global warming 100a, abiotic depletion, abiotic depletion [fossil fuel], ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication). All impact categories are higher in ZCBs than in VRFBs except water footprint and acidification. These midpoint impacts are also compared with conventional batteries (lithium) and nonconventional ones (NaNiCl). VRFBs have the lowest environmental impact and a longer life considering the reuse of vanadium electrolytes. Regarding the cost analysis, the electrolyte is the most expensive component of both batteries.

**Abstract:**
> Summary Microgrids (MGs) are known as suitable options to accommodatethe high penetration of renewable energies, like solar and wind. MGs have provided the requirements of controlling and adjusting these sources. In addition, batteries are becoming indispensable components of MGs because of their capabilities in addressing the renewable energies' power output intermittency. In MGs, the problem of smart energymanagement along with battery sizing has been introduced as the necessity to ensure the efficient use of renewable sources and decrease traditional fossil‐fuel‐based generation technology penetration level in power systems. Accordingly, a novel method is presented in this paper to effectively address the above‐mentioned requirements, utilizing the modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA), applied to different case studies. The results, obtained from the numerical simulation, are compared to several well‐established optimization approaches to verify the performance of MSFLA. In terms of computational efficiency and quality of the obtained solution, the MSFLA has demonstrated promising outcomes, together with superior performance in comparison with other algorithms. The results show that the presented framework, including the battery sizing, would be very beneficial to minimize the operating cost of MGs.

**Abstract:**
> Herein, a novel cost‐effective demand side management and peak power shaving are demonstrated by optimized scheduling of renewable energy source integrated grid‐connected hybrid microgrid and vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) storage. To promote the waste to energy for the rural and urban communities, the biogas energy source is integrated along with the combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy sources. As a long life and scalable battery storage solution, VRFB storage is adopted for peak shaving and microgrid performance reliability. Power generation from the renewable sources, VRFB charge–discharge, and grid power usage are scheduled considering two practical electricity tariff profiles, thus making the overall microgrid system operation cost‐effective and efficient. The optimized cost of energy management is determined considering the operation and maintenance cost of energy source and battery storage, grid tariff profile, and power import and export. The performance of the overall control scheme is experimentally validated by a grid‐connected hybrid microgrid consisting of 10 kWp solar PV, 1 kW wind turbine, 15 kVA biogas engine generator, and 1 kW 6 h VRFB storage. The proposed energy management scheme is scalable and a generalized one that claims to be suitable for large‐scale renewable energy integrated power systems as well.

**Abstract:**
> The aim of this research is to analyze the techno-economic performance of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) using batteries, pumped hydro-based, and hydrogen-based storage units at Sharurah, Saudi Arabia. The simulations and optimization process are carried out for nine HRES scenarios to determine the optimum sizes of components for each scenario. The optimal sizing of components for each HRES scenario is determined based on the net present cost (NPC) optimization criterion. All of the nine optimized HRES scenarios are then evaluated based on NPC, levelized cost of energy, payback period, CO2 emissions, excess electricity, and renewable energy fraction. The simulation results show that the photovoltaic (PV)-diesel-battery scenario is economically the most viable system with the NPC of US$2.70 million and levelized cost of energy of US$0.178/kWh. Conversely, PV-diesel-fuel cell system is proved to be economically the least feasible system. Moreover, the wind-diesel-fuel cell is the most economical scenario in the hydrogen-based storage category. PV-wind-diesel-pumped hydro scenario has the highest renewable energy fraction of 89.8%. PV-wind-diesel-pumped hydro scenario is the most environment-friendly system, with an 89% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with the base-case diesel only scenario. Overall, the systems with battery and pumped hydro storage options have shown better techno-economic performance compared with the systems with hydrogen-based storage.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The recent proliferation of renewable energy generation offers mankind hope, with regard to combatting global climate change. However, reaping the full benefits of these renewable energy sources requires the ability to store and distribute any renewable energy generated in a cost‐effective, safe, and sustainable manner. As such, sodium‐ion batteries (NIBs) have been touted as an attractive storage technology due to their elemental abundance, promising electrochemical performance and environmentally benign nature. Moreover, new developments in sodium battery materials have enabled the adoption of high‐voltage and high‐capacity cathodes free of rare earth elements such as Li, Co, Ni, offering pathways for low‐cost NIBs that match their lithium counterparts in energy density while serving the needs for large‐scale grid energy storage. In this essay, a range of battery chemistries are discussed alongside their respective battery properties while keeping metrics for grid storage in mind. Matters regarding materials and full cell cost, supply chain and environmental sustainability are discussed, with emphasis on the need to eliminate several elements (Li, Ni, Co) from NIBs. Future directions for research are also discussed, along with potential strategies to overcome obstacles in battery safety and sustainable recyclability.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The demand for electrochemical energy storage technologies is rapidly increasing due to the proliferation of renewable energy sources and the emerging markets of grid‐scale battery applications. The properties of batteries are ideal for most electrical energy storage (EES) needs, yet, faced with resource constraints, the ability of current lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) to match this overwhelming demand is uncertain. Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are a novel class of batteries with similar performance characteristics to LIBs. Since they are composed of earth‐abundant elements, cheaper and utility scale battery modules can be assembled. As a result of the learning curve in the LIB technology, a phenomenal progression in material development has been realized in the SIB technology. In this review, innovative strategies used in SIB material development, and the electrochemical properties of anode, cathode, and electrolyte combinations are elucidated. Attractive performance characteristics are herein evidenced, based on comparative gravimetric and volumetric energy densities to state‐of‐the‐art LIBs. In addition, opportunities and challenges toward commercialization are herein discussed based on patent data trend analysis. With extensive industrial adaptations expected, the commercial prospects of SIBs look promising and this once discarded technology is set to play a major role in EES applications.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract This paper aims to reduce LCOE (levelized cost of energy), NPC (net present cost), unmet load, and greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing an optimized solar photovoltaic (SPV)/battery energy storage (BES) off‐grid integrated renewable energy system configured with a 21‐kW SPV, 5707.8 kW BES, and a 12‐kW converter system. The LCOE is reduced to 14.73% of that obtained in the diesel generator (DG)‐only system by deploying the proposed energy system and to 28.61% of that obtained in the DG/battery energy system. The NPC is reduced to 14.78% of that DG and 28.70% of that DG/battery energy system. By sensitivity analysis, it is found that LCOE decreases with the increasing inflation rate and also with the decreasing discount rate. A performance compression analysis between the designed energy system and similar recent studies has also been presented. The proposed energy system reduces diesel consumption by at least 8113 L/year and total greenhouse gas emissions by at least 21 545 kg/year in the study area. Also, 13.9% of excess energy is produced per year at only 0.02% of the unmet load percentage. These outcomes are extremely relevant for making investments in policies for supplying electricity to a residential load in a low‐load profile area.

**Abstract:**
> The high demand for clean and renewable energy has fueled the exploration of advanced energy storage systems. As a potential alternative device for lithium ion batteries, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted extraordinary attention and are becoming a promising candidate for energy storage due to their low cost and high efficiency. Recent progress has demonstrated that metal sulfides (MSs) are very promising electrode candidates for efficient Na‐storage devices, because of their excellent redox reversibility and relatively high capacity. In this review, recent developments of MSs as anode materials for NIBs are presented. The corresponding electrochemical mechanisms are briefly discussed. We also present critical issues, challenges, and perspectives with the hope of providing a fuller understanding of the associated electrochemical processes. Such an understanding is critical for tailoring and designing metal sulfides with the desired activity and stability.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract The development of various redox‐flow batteries for the storage of fluctuating renewable energy has intensified in recent years because of their peculiar ability to be scaled separately in terms of energy and power, and therefore potentially to reduce the costs of energy storage. This has resulted in a considerable increase in the number of publications on redox‐flow batteries. This was a motivation to present a comprehensive and critical overview of the features of this type of batteries, focusing mainly on the chemistry of electrolytes and introducing a thorough systematic classification to reveal their potential for future development.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Energy storage technology has received significant attention for portable electronic devices, electric vehicle propulsion, bulk electricity storage at power stations, and load leveling of renewable sources, such as solar energy and wind power. Lithium ion batteries have dominated most of the first two applications. For the last two cases, however, moving beyond lithium batteries to the element that lies below—sodium—is a sensible step that offers sustainability and cost‐effectiveness. This requires an evaluation of the science underpinning these devices, including the discovery of new materials, their electrochemistry, and an increased understanding of ion mobility based on computational methods. The Review considers some of the current scientific issues underpinning sodium ion batteries.

**Abstract:**
> Abstract Sodium ion batteries are attractive for the rapidly emerging large‐scale energy storage market for intermittent renewable resources. Currently a viable cathode material does not exist for practical non‐aqueous sodium ion battery applications. Here we disclose a high performance, durable electrode material based on the 3D NASICON framework. Porous Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /C was synthesized using a novel solution‐based approach. This material, as a cathode, is capable of delivering an energy storage capacity of ∼400 mWh/g vs. sodium metal. Furthermore, at high current rates (10, 20 and 40 C), it displayed remarkable capacity retention. Equally impressive is the long term cycle life. Nearly 50% of the initial capacity was retained after 30,000 charge/discharge cycles at 40 C (4.7 A/g). Notably, coulombic efficiency was 99.68% (average) over the course of cycling. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of high energy density, high power density and ultra long cycle life demonstrated here has never been reported before for sodium ion batteries. We believe our findings will have profound implications for developing large‐scale energy storage systems for renewable energy sources.
