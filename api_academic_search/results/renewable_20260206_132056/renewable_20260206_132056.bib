  abstract = {Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable ene},
