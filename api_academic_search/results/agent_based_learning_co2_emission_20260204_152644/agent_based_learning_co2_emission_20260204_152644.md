                  Electricity competition, restrictions on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and arm races between nations are examples of social dilemmas within human society. In the presence of social dilemmas, rational choice in game theory leads to the avoidance of cooperative behaviour owing to its cost. However, in experiments using public goods games that simulate social dilemmas, humans have often exhibited cooperative behaviour that deviates from individual rationality. Despite ex...

Pursuant to this, energy service demands play a critical role in the energy systems and integrated assessment models but fail to get the attention they warrant. This study introduces a novel custom deep learning neural network architecture (called TrebuNet) that mimics the p...

**Abstract:**

> Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a promising data-driven approach for traffic signal control, especially because DRL can learn to adapt to varying traffic demands. For that, DRL agents maximize a scalar reward by interacting with an environment. However, one needs to formulate a suitable reward, aligning agent behavior and user objectives, which is an open research problem. We investigate this problem in the context of traffic signal control with the objective of minimizing CO2 emissions at ...

Vehicles act as the agents of the model, and traffic ...

This has caused an increase in the average global temperatures by nearly 0.7 degree centigrade due to the greenhouse effect. However, the most prosperous states are the highest emitters of greenhouse gases (specially, CO2). This indicates a strong relationship between gaseous emissions and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the states. Such a relationship is highly volat...

They argue that ABM offers a more efficient approach to auction design than the usual mechanistic models. The authors set up the essential components of any market institution far beyond supply and demand. They build an ABM for the emissions permits auction of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), and de...

**Abstract:**

> Abstract Gas Oil Gravity Drainage (GOGD) of the Qarn Alam fractured low permeability carbonate reservoir is being enhanced by steam injection in the world's first full field development carbonate thermal development. Unlike a normal steam flood, the steam is used as a heating agent to enhance the existing gravity drainage mechanisms, and project has proved to be viable based on encouraging pilot results. The elegance of the thermally assisted - GOGD is that the fracture network is both used for ...

**Abstract:**

> In this two-part paper we evaluate the effect of âendogenizingâ technological learning and strategic behavior of agents in economic models used to assess climate change policies. In the first part we show the potential impact of R&amp;D policies or demonstration and deployment (D&amp;D) programs in the context of stringent stabilization scenarios. In the second part we show how game-theoretic methods can be implemented in climate change economic models to take into account three types of str...
