      "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of energy, economic, and environmental policies on Türkiye’s energy dynamics and CO2 emissions using climate models and an agent-based simulation (ABM) framework. By integrating climate projections with policy scenarios, it assesses how energy transitions and climate change affect renewable energy sources (RES), cooling demands, and CO2 emissions from electricity generation. Methods include selecting suitable Global Climate Models (GCMs), evaluating climate change impacts on RES performance, and simulating policy effects through ABM across one base and nine policy scenarios from 2023 to 2040. The study highlights the critical role of policy interventions in influencing emissions trends and energy prices. It identifies renewable energy subsidies and low-carbon strategies, such as nuclear power support, as effective tools for reducing emissions and stabilizing energy costs. The methodologies and findings provide actionable insights for policymakers globally, emphasizing the importance of integrating climate data with policy planning.",

      "abstract": "The transition of Türkiye’s energy market toward net-zero emissions by 2053 requires modeling approaches capable of capturing complex interactions and long-term uncertainties. In this study, a long-term agent-based modeling (ABM) framework was developed, integrating econometric demand forecasting with a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and machine learning (ML)-based day-ahead market (DAM) price prediction. Of the ML models tested, CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest, and supported investment analysis through net present value (NPV) calculations. The framework represents major market actors—including generation units, investors, and the market operator—while also incorporating the impact of Türkiye’s first nuclear power plant (NPP) under construction and the potential introduction of a carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS). All model components were validated against historical data, confirming robust forecasting and market replication performance. Hourly simulations were conducted until 2053 under alternative policy and demand scenarios. The results show that renewable generation expands steadily, led by onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV), while nuclear capacity, ETS implementation, and demand assumptions significantly reshape prices, generation mix, and carbon emissions. The nuclear plant lowers market prices, whereas an ETS substantially raises them, with both policies contributing to emission reductions. These scenario results were connected to actionable policy recommendations, outlining how renewable expansion, ETS design, nuclear development, and energy efficiency measures can jointly support Türkiye’s 2053 net-zero target. The proposed framework provides an ex-ante decision-support framework for policymakers, investors, and market participants, with future extensions that can include other energy markets, storage integration, and enriched scenario design.",

      "abstract": "With rapid urbanization and increasing mobility demand, urban traffic systems face intensifying congestion, resulting in elevated CO2 emissions. This paper provides a systematic review of the current status of models estimating CO2 emissions from urban road traffic, considering their applicability across various traffic management scenarios. Urban road traffic CO2 emission models can generally be categorized into two main types. Traditional models typically estimate emissions based on average speed, traffic conditions, or vehicle operation modes, whereas data-driven models leverage techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to capture complex emission patterns. The review proposes a set of model selection criteria, namely data availability, computational complexity, interpretability, and transferability. Based on a comparative evaluation of these criteria, the study finds that there is no one-size-fits-all model so far. Instead, model suitability depends heavily on local data infrastructure and specific application needs. Therefore, future work needs to enhance model localization and personalization to improve estimation accuracy, while the integration of spatiotemporal data-driven modeling approaches is likely to become a research hotspot in upcoming studies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are essential for achieving the 1.5 °C target. Predicting the emission reduction potential of CCUS technology is particularly important for countries to pursue carbon neutrality. However, the existing literature assessing the potential lacks consideration of the structural changes in industrial product demand and the trade-offs companies face between CCUS and traditional emission reduction technologies. This study used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the emission reduction potential of CCUS in China’s thermal power, steel, cement, and chemical industries from 2022 to 2060 under scenarios of different carbon prices, subsidies, and technology progress rates. The possible biases of the traditional prediction model were corrected incorporating the structural changes in industrial product demand and the marginal abatement cost curves of traditional emission reduction technologies for the four major industries into the ABM model. The simulation results indicate that under each of the ten possible scenarios, China’s CCUS technologies will reach 100% penetration in the four mentioned industries by 2060, with the emission reduction potential fluctuating between 2222 and 1568 Mt of CO2 (corresponding to 40% and 10% share of thermal power, respectively). The difference comes in the scaled-up threshold time point and the growth trend. Sensitivity analyses show that the carbon price affects changes in the emission reduction potential of CCUS technologies the most, while the impact of subsidies, rates of technological progress and oil prices were not significant. The stepped carbon price policy can effectively regulate and promote the expansion of CCUS emission reduction potential, which is worth considering for policymakers.",

      "abstract": "The cities are the largest emitters of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world, with close to a quarter of the total energy‐related CO2 emissions occurring in urban places. As urbanization and demand to move surge in transiting, traditional monomodal transport systems, especially the ones that rely on the use of personal vehicles, are inefficient given the low efficiency, and thus unaffordable to support the goal of sustainability. The current article suggests the idea of an artificial intelligence (AI)‐powered, Internet of Things (IoT)‐compatible real‐time multimodal optimization tool to minimize urban emissions yet improve the efficient mobility of people and goods. The system unites AI algorithms, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and the data streams based on the IoT devices connected to road sensors, GPS, mobile apps, and the public transportation systems. It actively suggests the best paths and combinations of methods of transport (e.g., walking, biking, bus, metro) according to the traffic, weather, user preferences, and emission characteristics in real time. Through simulations that have been carried out in the simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) platform on a modeled city, average CO2 emissions per trip have been reduced by 45% compared with baseline routing strategies. Further findings indicate the use of suggested alternatives with high user acceptance rate (83%) and efficient modal shifts of the avoided use of a private car. The suggested framework provides a data‐driven and scalable framework of sustainable urban mobility. Considering that it integrates modeling of emissions into the central optimization engine, enables real‐time, personalized decision‐making, it can help achieve climate action as well as aid in the smart city development. The proposed AI–IoT framework demonstrably reduces CO2 emissions and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 11 (cities, targets 11.2/11.6), SDG 13 (climate, target 13.2), and SDG 9 (infrastructure, targets 9.1/9.4) with secondary alignment to SDG 7.3 on energy efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Traffic congestion at a single intersection can propagate and thus affect adjacent intersections as well, potentially resulting in prolonged gridlock across an entire urban area. Despite numerous research efforts aimed at developing intelligent traffic signal control systems, urban areas continue to experience traffic congestion. This paper presents a novel agent-based fuzzy traffic control system for multiple road intersections. The proposed system is designed to operate in a decentralized manner, with each intersection having its own agent (fuzzy controller) functioning concurrently. The intelligent fuzzy controller of the system can recognize emergency vehicles, assess the queue length and waiting time of vehicles, measure the distance of vehicles from intersections, and consider the cumulated waiting times of short vehicle queues. Two distinct types of agent-based intelligent fuzzy traffic control systems were implemented for comparison: one involving collaboration between an agent and its immediate neighboring agent(s) (where one intersection exchanges traffic data with its immediate neighboring intersection(s)), and the other implementing a non-collaborative agent-based intelligent fuzzy traffic control system (where the individual intersection has no direct communication). Following the experimental simulations, the results were compared with those of existing intelligent fuzzy traffic control systems that lack any module to calculate the distance of the vehicles from the intersection. The results demonstrated that the proposed agent-based system of controllers exhibited superior performance compared with the existing fuzzy controllers in terms of indicators such as average waiting time, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. For instance, the proposed system reduced the average waiting time of vehicles at an intersection by 48.65% compared with the existing three-stage intelligent fuzzy traffic control system. In addition, a comparison was conducted between non-collaborating and collaborating agent-based intelligent fuzzy traffic control systems, where collaboration achieved better results than the non-collaborating system. In the simulation experiments, an interesting new feature emerged: despite any direct communication missing at multiple intersections, green waves evolved with time. This emergent feature suggests that fuzzy controllers have the potential to evolve and adapt to traffic complexity issues in urban environments when operating in an autonomous agent-based mode. This study demonstrates that agent-based fuzzy controllers can effectively communicate with one another to share traffic data and improve the overall system performance.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative hybrid methodology that integrates deterministic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization with stochastic Agent-Based Simulation to address the PDP-TW. The approach is applied to real-world operational data from a luggage-handling company in Lisbon, covering 158 service requests from January 2025. The MILP model generates optimal routing and task allocation plans, which are subsequently stress-tested under realistic uncertainties, such as variability in travel and service times, using ABS implemented in AnyLogic. The framework is iterative: violations of temporal or capacity constraints identified during the simulation are fed back into the optimization model, enabling successive adjustments until robust and feasible solutions are achieved for real-world scenarios. Additionally, the study incorporates transshipment scenarios, evaluating the impact of using warehouses as temporary hubs for order redistribution. Results include a comparative analysis between deterministic and stochastic models regarding operational efficiency, time window adherence, reduction in travel distances, and potential decreases in CO2 emissions. This work provides a contribution to the literature by proposing a practical and robust decision-support framework aligned with contemporary demands for sustainability and efficiency in urban logistics, overcoming the limitations of purely deterministic approaches by explicitly reflecting real-world uncertainties.",

The complexity of these interactions makes it difficult to devise strategies that effectively balance competing priorities, such as economic growth, environmental protection, and social inclusion. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates the Integrated Green Transition Model (IGTM) and the Sustainable Transition Optimization Framework (STOF).MethodsIGTM employs agent-based modeling and network dynamics to simulate the cascading impacts of green policies on energy systems and socio-economic outcomes, while STOF leverages advanced optimization and machine learning techniques to balance economic growth, emission reductions, and social equity under diverse scenarios.ResultsBy synthesizing these approaches, our study provides actionable insights into the economic impact of climate risk and offers robust strategies for optimizing investments in renewable energy and policy interventions. The results highlight the necessity of aligning technological innovation, governance, and public engagement to accelerate the green transformation while minimizing economic disruptions.DiscussionFostering international cooperation and sharing best practices across nations will be pivotal in overcoming global climate challenges and ensuring a just transition for all. This research underscores the urgency of implementing integrated solutions to safeguard a sustainable and equitable future. Unlike traditional models, IGTM simulates the cascading impacts of green policies on energy and socio-economic systems, while STOF uses machine learning to balance growth, emissions, and equity.

      "abstract": "Urban traffic congestion is a significant challenge faced by cities globally, resulting in delays, increased emissions, and diminished quality of life. This study introduces an innovative traffic load-balancing algorithm developed as part of the IN2CCAM Horizon 2020 project, which was specifically tested in the city of Vigo, Spain. The proposed method incorporates short-term traffic forecasting through machine learning models—primarily Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—alongside a dynamic routing algorithm designed to equalize travel times across alternative routes. Historical speed and volume data collected from Bluetooth sensors were analyzed and modeled to predict traffic conditions 15 min ahead. The algorithm was implemented within the PTV Vissim microsimulation environment to assess its effectiveness. Results from 20 distinct traffic scenarios demonstrated significant improvements: an increase in average speed of up to 3%, an 8% reduction in delays, and a 10% decrease in total standstill time during peak weekday hours. Furthermore, average emissions of CO2, NOx, HC, and CO were reduced by 4% to 11% across the scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of integrating predictive analytics with real-time load balancing to enhance traffic efficiency and promote environmental sustainability in urban areas. The proposed approach can further support policymakers and traffic operators in designing more sustainable mobility strategies and optimizing future urban traffic management systems.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the integration of proximity theory (PT) into the management of public transport service disruptions within sustainable Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) systems, an area that is largely underexplored. PT provides a multidimensional framework for analyzing relationships and interactions within complex systems, encompassing five dimensions: geographical, cognitive, institutional, organizational, and social, each influencing coordination, learning, and adaptability. Building on this framework, the study introduces temporal proximity as an original sub-dimension of geographical proximity, forming a spatial–temporal proximity theory (PTST), which highlights the critical role of timing, synchronization, and coordinated responses in transport disruption management. To operationalize these principles, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model was developed to optimize traveler assignments across 50 routes for 10 travelers, minimizing delays, transfers, walking distance, crowding, and CO2 emissions. Two scenarios were analyzed: one without environmental considerations and another with CO2 penalties. Results show that emissions were reduced by up to 50% for certain routes, while maintaining feasible travel times and route choices. The case study demonstrates that PTST can be operationalized as a practical tool, bridging mobility resilience and environmental responsibility, and providing actionable insights for sustainable and intelligent MaaS platforms.",

      "abstract": "Traffic lights operating on a fixed schedule are mostly time-consuming; for example, running green signals in the absence of vehicles, leading to a buildup of long queues at red lights. This inefficiency results in congestion in cities, contributes to delays and economic losses and intensifies pollution levels. In this study, a deep learning-based adaptive image processing traffic light control system for real-time dynamic regulation of signals was proposed. Different from typical sensor-based solutions, the proposed method uses established surveillance cameras, enabling cost-efficient deployment and easy installation. A YOLOv10-based detection model identifies and classifies vehicles by type, applying weight factors to effectively estimate traffic demand. A dynamic timing algorithm enables continuous redistribution of green-light durations due to existing unbalances in the flow for any or all intersection phases. A practical microcontroller-based system might be integrated directly into the existing infrastructure. For assessment, the model used data from 12,500 images labelled accordingly and divided into the following: 70% for training, 15% for validation and 15% for testing. The model was assessed in a SUMO-based simulation of a very busy four-way intersection and actual deployment in Baghdad, Iraq. Compared with fixed time control, this adaptive system reduced vehicle wait time by up to 91.7%. Furthermore, results indicate reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, thereby leading to considerable economic and environmental benefits. Overall, the proposed framework represents a practical and scalable implementation for modern traffic management, overlooking possible implementations of enhancements such as prioritisation of emergency vehicles and multi-intersection coordination.",

      "abstract": "Modular integrated construction (MiC) is a cutting-edge approach to construction that significantly improves efficiency and reduces project timelines by prefabricating entire building modules off-site. Despite the operational benefits of MiC, the carbon footprint of its extensive supply chain remains understudied. This study develops a hybrid approach that combines multi-agent simulation (MAS) with deep learning to provide scenario-based estimations of CO2 emissions, costs, and schedule performance for MiC supply chain. First, we build an MAS model of the MiC supply chain in AnyLogic, representing suppliers, the prefabrication plant, road transport fleets, and the destination site as autonomous agents. Each agent incorporates activity data and emission factors specific to the process. This enables us to translate each movement, including prefabricated components of construction deliveries, module transfers, and module assembly, into kilograms of CO2 equivalent. We generate 23,000 scenarios for vehicle allocations using the multi-agent model and estimate three key performance indicators (KPIs): cumulative carbon footprint, logistics cost, and project completion time. Then, we train artificial neural network and statistical regression machine learning algorithms to captures the non-linear interactions between fleet allocation decisions and project outcomes. Once trained, the models are used to determine optimal fleet allocation strategies that minimize the carbon footprint, the completion time, and the total cost. The approach can be readily adapted to different MiC configurations and can be extended to include supply chain, production, and assembly disruptions.",

This research is conducted by means of an Agent-Based Model (ABM), based on Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), implemented in GAMS. The ABM facilitates the simulation of interaction among farmers, allowing for an analysis of farm heterogeneity. The PMP methodology adds a non-rational dimention to the farmers’ economic drivers.

Our findings reveal significant impacts on land use, with a notable decrease in cereal cultivation in favour of protein and fodder crops. Moreover, structural shifts are observed, notably a decrease in the number of small-scale farms. We also assess environmental and economic implications, observing a modest reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions per hectare, an increase in water demand, and an overall economic stability among farms, as indicated by changes in gross margin per hectare.",

In the presence of social dilemmas, rational choice in game theory leads to the avoidance of cooperative behaviour owing to its cost. However, in experiments using public goods games that simulate social dilemmas, humans have often exhibited cooperative behaviour that deviates from individual rationality. Despite extensive research, the alignment between human cooperative behaviour and game theory predictions remains inconsistent. This study proposes an alternative approach to solve this problem. We used Q-learning, a form of artificial intelligence that mimics decision-making processes of humans who do not possess the rationality assumed in game theory. This study explores the potential for cooperation by varying the number of participants in public goods games using deep Q-learning. The simulations demonstrate that agents with Q-learning can acquire cooperative behaviour similar to that of humans. Moreover, we found that cooperation is more likely to occur as the group size increases. These results support and reinforce existing experiments involving humans. In addition, they have potential applications for creating cooperation without sanctions.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundTrees are a critical part of urban infrastructure. Cities worldwide are pledging afforestation objectives due to net-zero targets; however, their realisation requires a comprehensive framework that combines science, policy, and practice.MethodsThe paper presents the Green Urban Scenarios (GUS) framework for designing and monitoring green infrastructures. GUS considers weather, maintenance, tree species, diseases, and spatial distributions of trees to forecast their impacts. The framework uses agent-based modelling (ABM) and simulation paradigm to integrate green infrastructure into a city’s ecological, spatial, economic, and social context. ABM enables the creation of digital twins for urban ecosystems at any level of granularity, including individual trees, to accurately predict their future trajectories. Digital representation of trees is created using a combination of datasets such as earth observations from space, street view images, field surveys, and qualitative descriptions of typologies within existing and future projects. Machine learning and statistical models calibrate biomass growth patterns and carbon release schemes.ResultsThe paper examines various green area typologies, simulating several hypothetical scenarios based on Glasgow’s urban forests. It exhibits the emergence of heterogeneity features of the forests due to interactions among trees. The growth trajectory of trees has a non-linear transition phase toward stable growth in its maturity. Reduced maintenance deteriorates the health of trees leading to lower survival rate and increased CO2emissions, while the stormwater alleviation capacity may differ among species.ConclusionsThe paper demonstrates how GUS can facilitate policies and maintenance of urban forests with environmental, social, and economic benefits.",

      "abstract": "The effective management of urban waste represents a growing challenge in the face of demographic evolution and increased consumption. This study explores the impacts of municipal strategic decisions on household waste management behaviours and sustainability performance outcomes through agent-based modelling. Using data from Gatineau and Beaconsfield in Quebec, Canada, the model is calibrated and validated to represent diverse urban contexts. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing collection frequency leads to notable increases in participation rates, reaching 78.2 ± 5.1% for collections every two weeks and 96.5 ± 8.3% for collections every five weeks. While this reduction improves bin filling levels, it concurrently decreases the recovery of recyclable materials by 2.8% and 19.5%, significantly undermining the environmental benefits of the recycling program. These findings highlight a complex interplay between collection frequency, citizen participation behaviour, waste stream characteristics, and overall environmental performance. While reducing collection frequency initially appears beneficial, it leads to operational challenges and increased CO2 emissions due to reduced material recovery. The research emphasises the need for tailored holistic waste management strategies that optimise performance outcomes while minimising environmental impacts. By understanding these dynamics, municipalities can develop more effective waste management policies that promote sustainability.",

      "abstract": "As greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from road networks significantly impact the urban environment, there has been a growing interest in integrating environmental factors into traffic controls. Traffic signal control (TSC) is an effective method to reduce air pollution by managing traffic congestion. Accordingly, several recent studies have applied artificial intelligence to TSC to improve traffic efficiency. Despite these efforts, there are a few limitations on the existing studies. First of all, a number of recent studies focus only on traffic performance rather than environmental effects. However, in some cases, the objective function related to traffic efficiency can have an adverse effect on the environment. Furthermore, the variable nature of emissions based on traffic demand is rarely considered. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based TSC to minimize GHGs in traffic networks. To this end, we first identify vehicle's stop and delay as key factors in traffic efficiency that critically influence air quality. Subsequently, we integrate these factors into our model's reward function. To validate the proposed model, we conduct experiments under various demand scenarios featuring different traffic volume levels. The results show that the proposed model outperforms comparative control methods in two aspects: traffic performance and environmental sustainability. Especially at a high congestion level, the proposed model reduces average delay time by 11.9–16.1% and increases total throughput by 11.5%. Additionally, it significantly lowers total CO2 emissions by up to 8.9% and average emissions by up to 18.3%.",

      "abstract": "High temporal resolution CO2 emission data are crucial for understanding the drivers of emission changes, however, current emission dataset is only available on a yearly basis. Here, we extended a global daily CO2 emissions dataset backwards in time to 1970 using machine learning algorithm, which was trained to predict historical daily emissions on national scales based on relationships between daily emission variations and predictors established for the period since 2019. Variation in daily CO2 emissions far exceeded the smoothed seasonal variations. For example, the range of daily CO2 emissions equivalent to 31% of the year average daily emissions in China and 46% of that in India in 2022, respectively. We identified the critical emission-climate temperature (Tc) is 16.5 degree celsius for global average (18.7 degree celsius for China, 14.9 degree celsius for U.S., and 18.4 degree celsius for Japan), in which negative correlation observed between daily CO2 emission and ambient temperature below Tc and a positive correlation above it, demonstrating increased emissions associated with higher ambient temperature. The long-term time series spanning over fifty years of global daily CO2 emissions reveals an increasing trend in emissions due to extreme temperature events, driven by the rising frequency of these occurrences. This work suggests that, due to climate change, greater efforts may be needed to reduce CO2 emissions.",

      "abstract": "To alleviate intersection traffic congestion and reduce carbon emissions at intersections, research on exploiting reinforcement learning for intersection signal control has become a frontier topic in the field of intelligent transportation. This study utilizes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the D3QN (dueling double deep Q network) to achieve adaptive control of signal timings. Under a mixed traffic environment with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), this study constructs a reward function (Reward—CO2 Reduction) to minimize vehicle waiting time and carbon dioxide emissions at the intersection. Additionally, to account for the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of traffic flow, an adaptive-phase action space and a fixed-phase action space are designed to optimize action selections. The proposed algorithm is validated in a SUMO simulation with different traffic volumes and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results are compared with other control strategies like Webster’s method (fixed-time control). The analysis shows that the proposed model can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions when the traffic volume is low or medium. As the penetration rate of CAVs increases, the average carbon dioxide emissions and waiting time can be further reduced with the proposed model. The significance of this study lies in its dual achievement: by presenting a flexible strategy that not only reduces the environmental impact by lowering carbon dioxide emissions but also enhances traffic efficiency, it provides a tangible example of the advancement of green intelligent transportation systems.",

      "abstract": "The growing food demand, the tendency for organic food, and the adaptation of the e-commerce business model require new food supply chain management approaches. On the one hand, 30% of the world’s produced food is wasted, and CO2 emissions are rapidly growing due to transport. On the other hand, the increasingly complex and dynamic environment is decreasing the effectiveness of food supply chains. Because of these trends, sustainability and resilience are becoming more relevant to food supply chains. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a strategy based on information exchange to improve food quality and decrease the level of CO2 emission in last-mile deliveries of food products. To achieve this goal, an agent-based model of last-mile deliveries was developed. The model simulated traffic flow and traffic accidents as disturbances in the system while measuring the level of CO2 emission and food quality of the network. The simulation compares information sharing between all vehicles in the urban area and without information sharing in four scenarios of the food industry. In practice, information sharing is achieved by using connected vehicle technology. The use of information sharing between vehicles in last-mile delivery processes allows the development of a self-organizing system, which would adapt to disturbances and lead to the development of sustainability in the long run.",

Forecasting technologies pertaining to grey systems are in the spotlight due to the fact that they do not require many data points. In this work, an optimized model with grey machine learning architecture of a polynomial realization was employed to predict power generation, power consumption and CO2 emissions. A nonlinear kernel was taken and optimized with a recently published algorithm, the augmented crow search algorithm (ACSA), for prediction. It was found that as compared to conventional grey models, the proposed framework yields better results in terms of accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Process cooling for food production is an energy-intensive industry with complex interactions and restrictions that complicate the ability to utilize energy-flexibility due to unforeseen consequences in production. Therefore, methods for assessing the potential flexibility in individual facilities to enable the active participation of process-cooling facilities in the electricity system are essential, but not yet well discussed in the literature. Therefore, this paper introduces an assessment method based on multi-method simulation and multi-objective optimization for investigating energy flexibility in process cooling, with a case study of a Danish process-cooling facility for canned-meat food production. Multi-method simulation is used in this paper: multi-agent-based simulation to investigate individual entities within the process-cooling system and the system’s behavior; discrete-event simulation to explore the entire process-cooling flow; and system dynamics to capture the thermophysical properties of the refrigeration unit and states of the refrigerated environment. A simulation library is developed, and is able to represent a generic production-flow of the canned-food process cooling. A data-driven symbolic-regression approach determines the complex logic of individual agents. Using a binary tuple-matrix for refrigeration-schedule optimization, the refrigeration-cycle operation is determined, based on weather forecasts, electricity price, and electricity CO2 emissions without violating individual room-temperature limits. The simulation results of one-week’s production in October 2020 show that 32% of energy costs can be saved and 822 kg of CO2 emissions can be reduced. The results thereby show the energy-flexibility potential in the process-cooling facilities, with the benefit of overall production cost and CO2 emissions reduction; at the same time, the production quality and throughput are not influenced.",

This study introduces a novel custom deep learning neural network architecture (called TrebuNet) that mimics the physical process of firing a trebuchet to model the nuanced dynamics inherent in energy service demand estimation. Here we show, how TrebuNet is designed, trained, and used to estimate transport energy service demand. We find that the TrebuNet architecture shows superior performance compared with traditional multivariate linear regression and state of the art methods like densely connected neural network, Recurrent Neural Network, and Gradient Boosted machine learning algorithms when evaluated for regional demand projection for all modes of transport demands at short, decadal, and medium-term time horizons. Finally, TrebuNet introduces a framework to project energy service demand for regions having multiple countries spanning different socio-economic development pathways which can be replicated for wider regression-based task for timeseries having non-uniform variance.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               This work was motivated by the increasing need for proper metrics and tools to demonstrate the effect of mechanical performance, as a function of concrete mix composition, in dictating the dimensions of structural elements and associated costs and embodied carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Mixture compositions associated with different concrete technologies were compared using multi-criteria comparison indices derived using structural design considerations and calculated using information on compressive strength, volumetric embodied CO2 and unit costs. In addition, predicted compressive strengths obtained with machine learning (ML) models are used to calculate these indices for a domain of mix proportions associated with ultra-high-performance concrete materials to generate multi-objective density diagrams (MODDs). The makeup of this tool facilitates the evaluation of rather complicated trends associated with mix proportions and multi-objective outcomes, allowing ML-based tools to be of easy interpretation by industry personnel with no expertise in artificial intelligence. MODDs could be used as aids in the decision-making process during mix design stages and serve as proof of mixture optimization that could be introduced in environmental product declarations. Results show that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, high-binder content and ultra-high strength concrete technologies are not necessarily detrimental to cost and/or eco efficiencies. For the applications evaluated herein, optimum solutions were mostly obtained with these types of concrete, suggesting that industry trends toward requiring minimization of embodied carbon footprint on a per volume of concrete basis are misguided and should not be used as a standalone metric to minimize the total carbon footprint of concrete structures.",

      "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a promising data-driven approach for traffic signal control, especially because DRL can learn to adapt to varying traffic demands. For that, DRL agents maximize a scalar reward by interacting with an environment. However, one needs to formulate a suitable reward, aligning agent behavior and user objectives, which is an open research problem. We investigate this problem in the context of traffic signal control with the objective of minimizing CO2 emissions at intersections. Because CO2 emissions can be affected by multiple factors outside the agent’s control, it is unclear if an emission-based metric works well as a reward, or if a proxy reward is needed. To obtain a suitable reward, we evaluate various rewards and combinations of rewards. For each reward, we train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) on homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic scenarios. We use the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) simulator and its default emission model to monitor the agent’s performance on the specified rewards and CO2 emission. Our experiments show that a CO2 emission-based reward is inefficient for training a DQN, the agent’s performance is sensitive to variations in the parameters of combined rewards, and some reward formulations do not work equally well in different scenarios. Based on these results, we identify desirable reward properties that have implications to reward design for reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control.",

This study investigated gasoline vehicle emission characteristics with different gasoline detergency, explored synergistic emission reduction potentials, and developed versatile emission prediction models. The results indicate that improved fuel detergency leads to a reduction of 5.1% in fuel consumption, along with decreases of 3.2% in total CO2, 55.4% in CO, and 15.4% in HC emissions. However, during low-speed driving, CO2 and CO emissions reductions are limited, and HC emissions worsen. A synergistic emission reduction was observed, particularly with CO exhibiting a pronounced reduction compared to HC. The developed deep-learning-based vehicle emission model for different gasoline detergency (DPVEM-DGD) enables accurate emission predictions under various fuel detergency conditions. The Pearson correlation coefficients (Pearson’s r) between predicted and measured values of CO2, CO, and HC emissions before and after adding detergency agents are 0.913 and 0.934, 0.895 and 0.915, and 0.931 and 0.969, respectively. The predictive performance improves due to reduced peak emissions resulting from improved fuel detergency. Elevated gasoline detergency not only reduces exhaust emissions but also facilitates more refined emission management to a certain extent.",

Based on the multisource data collected from the transportation environments, CAVs with the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) system could merge into platoons and traverse the intersection quickly and smoothly. Meanwhile, the traffic information about the CAVs enables intelligent traffic signal controls with the help of DRL technologies. This research investigates the performance of a state-shared multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) controlled signal corridor with platooning-based CAVs. A corridor with seven intersections from the Ingolstadt Traffic Scenario (InTAS) in Germany is selected as a case study. The state information is shared between neighboring intersections to overcome the partial information observation of the decentralized agents in the MADRL framework. A platooning framework with specific CACC systems for the leading and following vehicles is proposed. Results indicate that the state-shared MADRL with CAV platoons could significantly decrease the total waiting time, average queue length, and total CO2 emission of the corridor by 80%, 73%, and 54%, respectively, which could be beneficial in further improving the intersection efficiency, designing future intersections, and cooperating signals and CAVs platoons.",

      "abstract": "Understanding why travel behavior differs between residents of urban centers and suburbs is key to sustainable urban planning. Especially in light of rapid urban growth, identifying housing locations that minimize travel demand and induced CO2 emissions is crucial to mitigate climate change. While the built environment plays an important role, the precise impact on travel behavior is obfuscated by residential self-selection. To address this issue, we propose a double machine learning approach to obtain unbiased, spatially-explicit estimates of the effect of the built environment on travel-related CO2 emissions for each neighborhood by controlling for residential self-selection. We examine how socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes moderate the effect and how it decomposes across the 5Ds of the built environment. Based on a case study for Berlin and the travel diaries of 32,000 residents, we find that the built environment causes household travel-related CO2 emissions to differ by a factor of almost two between central and suburban neighborhoods in Berlin. To highlight the practical importance for urban climate mitigation, we evaluate current plans for 64,000 new residential units in terms of total induced transport CO2 emissions.

      "abstract": "Nowadays, transportation networks face the challenge of sub-optimal control policies that can have adverse effects on human health, the environment, and contribute to traffic congestion. Increased levels of air pollution and extended commute times caused by traffic bottlenecks make intersection traffic signal controllers a crucial component of modern transportation infrastructure. Despite several adaptive traffic signal controllers in literature, limited research has been conducted on their comparative performance. Furthermore, despite carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions' significance as a global issue, the literature has paid limited attention to this area. In this report, we propose EcoLight, a reward shaping scheme for reinforcement learning algorithms that not only reduces CO2 emissions but also achieves competitive results in metrics such as travel time. We compare the performance of tabular Q-Learning, DQN, SARSA, and A2C algorithms using metrics such as travel time, CO2 emissions, waiting time, and stopped time. Our evaluation considers multiple scenarios that encompass a range of road users (trucks, buses, cars) with varying pollution levels.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the incorporation of data-driven machine learning techniques into process optimization. Such integration improves the computational time required for calculations during optimization and benefits the online application of advanced control algorithms. The proposed method is illustrated via the chemical absorption-based postcombustion CO2 capture process, which plays an important role in the reduction of CO2 emissions to address climate challenges. These processes simulated in a software environment are typically based on first-principle models and calculate physical properties from basic physical quantities such as mass and temperature. Employing first-principle models usually requires a long computation time, making process optimization and control challenging. To overcome this challenge, in this study, machine learning algorithms are used to simulate the postcombustion CO2 capture process. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms are employed to build models for prediction of carbon capture rate (CR) and specific reboiler duty (SRD). The R2 (a statistical measure that represents the fitness) of these models is, on average, greater than 90% for all the cases. XGBoost and SVR take 0.022 and 0.317 s, respectively, to predict CR and SRD of 1318 cases, whereas the first-principal process simulation model needs 3.15 s to calculate one case. The models built by XGBoost are employed in the optimization methods, such as an agent-based approach represented by the particle swarm optimization and stochastic technique indicated by the simulated annealing, to find specific optimal operating conditions. The most economical case, in which the CR is 72.2% and SRD is 4.3 MJ/kg, is obtained during optimization. The results show that computations with the data-driven models incorporated in the optimization technique are faster than first-principle modeling approaches. Thus, the application of machine learning techniques in the optimization of carbon capture technologies is demonstrated successfully.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, energy policymakers are asked to develop strategies to ensure an affordable clean energy supply as well as minimizing investment risks. In addition, the rise of several community engagement schemes and the uptake of user-scale technologies introduce uncertainties that may result in a disruptive factor for energy systems evolution. This paper introduces a novel scenario analysis approach for local energy planning that supports policymakers and investors in prioritizing new renewable power plant investments, addressing the risks deriving from citizens’ choices. Specifically, a combined analysis is performed on the adoption trends of distributed photovoltaic systems and electric vehicles that are expected to heavily influence the evolution of energy systems. For this reason, an energy model is developed for Pantelleria island, and its transition from an oil-based energy supply to a renewable one up to 2050 is investigated. It is demonstrated how optimal-cost renewable-based scenarios can assure a 45% to 52% CO2 emissions reduction and a 6% to 15% overall cost reduction with respect to the diesel-based business-as-usual scenario. The analyzed scenarios disclose the recommended investments in each renewable technology, considering their learning curves and the unpredictability of user-scale technology adoption. Consequently, priorities in the installation of renewable power plants are stressed, starting with the most resilient to future uncertainties, as well as promoting specific incentive measures for citizens’ commitment at a local scale.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart meters devices in smart grids is providing key support for measuring and analyzing the power consumption patterns. This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures. &copy; 2022 IEEE.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a privacy-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework to reduce carbon emissions of vehicles approaching light traffic intersections. Taking advantage of vehicular communications, traffic lights disseminate their state (i.e., traffic light cycle) among vehicles in their proximity. Then, the RL model is trained using public traffic lights data while preserving private car information locally (i.e., at the vehicle premises). Vehicles act as the agents of the model, and traffic infrastructure serves as the environment where the agent lives. Each time, the RL model decides if the vehicle should accelerate or decelerate (i.e., the model action) based on received traffic light observations. The optimal RL model strategy, dictating vehicles' driving speed, is learned following the proximal policy optimization algorithm. Results show that by moderating vehicles' speed when approximating traffic light intersections, gas emissions are reduced by 25% CO2 and 38% NOx emissions. The same happens for EVs that reduce energy consumption by 20W/h compared to not using the model. at intersections. The final impact of using the model refers to a negligible increment of 20s in the trip duration.",

The concentration of these gases has risen rapidly over the last century and if the trend continues it can cause many adverse climatic changes. There have been ways implemented to curb this by the government by limiting processes that emit a higher amount of CO2, one such greenhouse gas. However, there is mounting evidence that the CO2 numbers supplied by the government do not accurately reflect the performance of automobiles on the road. Our proposal of using artificial intelligence techniques to improve a previously rudimentary process takes a radical tack, but it fits the bill given the situation. To determine which algorithms and models produce the greatest outcomes, we compared them all and explored a novel method of ensembling them. Further, this can be used to foretell the rise in global temperature and to ground crucial policy decisions like the adoption of electric vehicles. To estimate emissions from vehicles, we used machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning on a massive dataset.",

      "abstract": "Ridesplitting, which is a form of pooled ridesourcing service, has great potential to alleviate the negative impacts of ridesourcing on the environment. However, most existing studies only explored its theoretical environmental benefits based on optimization models and simulations. By contrast, this study aims to reveal the real-world emission reduction of ridesplitting and its determinants based on the observed data of ridesourcing in Chengdu, China. Integrating the trip data with the COPERT model, this study calculates the CO2 emissions of shared rides (ridesplitting) and their substituted single rides (regular ridesourcing) to estimate the CO2 emission reduction of each ridesplitting trip. The results show that not all ridesplitting trips reduce emissions from ridesourcing in the real world. The CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting varies from trip to trip, averaging at 43.15g/km. Then, interpretable machine learning models, gradient boosting machines, are applied to explore the relationship between the CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting and its determinants. Based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, the overlap rate and detour rate of shared rides are identified to be the most important factors that determine the CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting. Increasing the overlap rate, the number of shared rides, average speed, and ride distance ratio while decreasing the detour rate, actual trip distance, and ride distance gap can increase the CO2 emission reduction rate of ridesplitting. In addition, nonlinear effects and interactions of the determinants are examined through the partial dependence plots. To sum up, this study provides a scientific method for the government and ridesourcing companies to better assess and optimize the environmental benefits of ridesplitting.",

Forecasting the environmental cost of energy production is necessary for better decision making and easing the switch to cleaner energy systems in order to reduce air pollution. This paper describes a hybrid approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an agent-based architecture for forecasting carbon dioxide (CO2) issued from different energy sources in the city of Annaba using real data. The system consists of multiple autonomous agents, divided into two types: firstly, forecasting agents, which forecast the production of a particular type of energy using the ANN models; secondly, core agents that perform other essential functionalities such as calculating the equivalent CO2 emissions and controlling the simulation. The development is based on Algerian gas and electricity data provided by the national energy company. The simulation consists firstly of forecasting energy production using the forecasting agents and calculating the equivalent emitted CO2. Secondly, a dedicated agent calculates the total CO2 emitted from all the available sources. It then computes the benefits of using renewable energy sources as an alternative way to meet the electric load in terms of emission mitigation and economizing natural gas consumption. The forecasting models showed satisfying results, and the simulation scenario showed that using renewable energy can help reduce the emissions by 369 tons of CO2 (3%) per day.",

      "abstract": "A decade after the publication of seminal papers on personal carbon trading (PCT), few empirical studies on its implementation exist. Investigating how to design, set up and implement a PCT scheme for a community or country raises several difficulties. For instance, it is unclear how to introduce a reduction rate of CO2 allowances to ensure a steady decrease in CO2 emissions from households. Computational approaches have been introduced to address these challenges of PCT by providing an opportunity to test counterfactual scenarios. Among the benefits of an agent-based modeling approach (ABM) is the potential to directly address dynamic developments and introduce counterfactual situations. In this paper, we review existing modeling approaches and present an ABM for PCT. With simulations of an artificial population of 1000 and 30,000 agents, we address questions on the price and reduction rate of allowances. A key contribution of our model is the inclusion of an adaptive reduction rate, which reduces the yearly allocated amount of allowances depending on a set CO2 abatement target. The results confirm that increased emissions targets are related to higher allowance prices and a higher proportion of buying households. Our analysis also suggests a significant path dependence in the dynamics of allowance prices and availability, but that adaptive reduction rates have little impact on outcomes other than the price. We discuss data availability and computational challenges to modeling a PCT scheme with an ABM. Ideal data to populate an ABM on PCT are not available due to the lack of real-world implementations of a PCT. Nonetheless, meaningful insights about the dynamics and the focal variables in a PCT scheme can be generated by the exploratory use of an ABM.",

      "abstract": "The use and coordination of multiple modes of travel efficiently, although beneficial, remains an overarching challenge for urban cities. This paper implements a distributed architecture of an eco-friendly transport guidance system by employing the agent-based paradigm. The paradigm uses software agents to model and represent the complex transport infrastructure of urban environments, including roads, buses, trolleybuses, metros, trams, bicycles, and walking. The system exploits live traffic data (e.g., traffic flow, density, and CO2 emissions) collected from multiple data sources (e.g., road sensors and SCOOT) to provide multimodal route recommendations for travelers through a dedicated application. Moreover, the proposed system empowers the transport management authorities to monitor the traffic flow and conditions of a city in real-time through a dedicated web visualization. We exhibit the advantages of using different types of agents to represent the versatile nature of transport networks and realize the concept of smart transportation. Commuters are supplied with multimodal routes that endeavor to reduce travel times and transport carbon footprint. A technical simulation was executed using various parameters to demonstrate the scalability of our multimodal traffic management architecture. Subsequently, two real user trials were carried out in Nottingham (United Kingdom) and Sofia (Bulgaria) to show the practicality and ease of use of our multimodal travel information system in providing eco-friendly route guidance. Our validation results demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized multimodal route guidance in inducing a positive travel behavior change and the ability of the agent-based route planning system to scale to satisfy the requirements of traffic infrastructure in diverse urban environments.",

As in this running world, no one cares about the wastage of food. However, this causes environment pollution as well as loss of many lives. A lot of researchers help in this era by introducing some great and beneficial projects. Our work is introducing a new approach by utilizing some low‐cost sensors. In this work, Arduino UNO is used as a microcontroller. We use the eNose system that comprises MQ4 and MQ135 to detect gas emission from different food items, i.e., meat, rice, rice and meat, and bread. We collect our data from these food items. The MQ4 sensor detects the CH4 gas while the MQ135 sensor detects CO2 and NH3 in this system. We use a 5 kg strain gauge load cell sensor and HX711 A/D converter as a weight sensor to measure the weight of food being wasted. To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of our system, we first calibrate our sensors as per recommendations to run in the environment with the flow. We collect our data using cooked, uncooked, and rotten food items. To make this system a smart system, we use a machine learning algorithm to predict the food items on the basis of gas emission. The decision tree algorithm was used for training and testing purposes. We use 70 instances of each food item in the dataset. On the rule set, we implement this system working to measure the weight of food wastage and to predict the food item. The Arduino UNO board fetches the sensor data and sends it to the computer system for interpretation and analysis. Then, the machine learning algorithm works to predict the food item. At the end, we get our data of which food item is wasted in what amount in one day. We found 92.65% accuracy in our system. This system helps in reducing the amount of food wastage at home and restaurants as well by the daily report of food wastage in their computer system.",

      "abstract": "One major source of air pollution is automobile emissions in urban areas. Although hybrid and fully electric vehicles are started to gain popularity, the majority of vehicles are still fuel-based. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation based controllers, there have been numerous studies applying such learning-based techniques to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Combining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) models called DRL has shown promising results when applied to urban Traffic Signal Control (TSC) for adaptive adjustment of traffic light schedules. Centralized and decentralized DRL-based controller models are proposed in literature to optimize the total system travel time. However, the associated impact of such learning-based TSCs to the air quality remains unexplored. In this paper, we examine the impact of DRL-based TSCs on the environment in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emission. We studied a major DRL approach called advantage actor-critic (A2C) using multi-agent settings on a synthetic multi-intersection network and on a real traffic network of San Francisco downtown with 24 hours traffic dataset. Our initial results indicate that learning based DRL methods achieved the lowest air pollution level on synthetic networks even with a simple delay-based reward function. However, DRL-based TSC performs slightly worse than rule-based adaptive TSCs (max-pressure control) in the San Francisco network.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\nIn the last decade, instigated by the Paris agreement and United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP22 and COP23), the efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels are expanding. The required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply a massive decarbonization worldwide with much involvement of regions, cities, businesses, and individuals in addition to the commitments at the national levels. Improving end-use efficiency is emphasized in previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2014). Serving as the primary ‘agents of change’ in the transformative process towards green economies, households have a key role in global emission reduction. Individual actions, especially when amplified through social dynamics, shape green energy demand and affect investments in new energy technologies that collectively can curb regional and national emissions. However, most energy-economics models—usually based on equilibrium and optimization assumptions—have a very limited representation of household heterogeneity and treat households as purely rational economic actors. This paper illustrates how computational social science models can complement traditional models by addressing this limitation. We demonstrate the usefulness of behaviorally rich agent-based computational models by simulating various behavioral and climate scenarios for residential electricity demand and compare them with the business as usual (SSP2) scenario. Our results show that residential energy demand is strongly linked to personal and social norms. Empirical evidence from surveys reveals that social norms have an essential role in shaping personal norms. When assessing the cumulative impacts of these behavioral processes, we quantify individual and combined effects of social dynamics and of carbon pricing on individual energy efficiency and on the aggregated regional energy demand and emissions. The intensity of social interactions and learning plays an equally important role for the uptake of green technologies as economic considerations, and therefore in addition to carbon-price policies (top-down approach), implementing policies on education, social and cultural practices can significantly reduce residential carbon emissions.",

      "abstract": "In the last 150 years, CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million. This has caused an increase in the average global temperatures by nearly 0.7 degree centigrade due to the greenhouse effect. However, the most prosperous states are the highest emitters of greenhouse gases (specially, CO2). This indicates a strong relationship between gaseous emissions and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the states. Such a relationship is highly volatile and nonlinear due to its dependence on the technological advancements and constantly changing domestic and international regulatory policies and relations. To analyse such vastly nonlinear relationships, soft computing techniques has been quite effective as they can predict a compact solution for multi-variable parameters without any explicit insight into the internal system functionalities. This paper reports a novel transfer learning based approach for GDP prediction, which we have termed as Domain Adapted Transfer Learning for GDP Prediction. In the proposed approach per capita GDP of different nations is predicted using their CO2 emissions via a model trained on the data of any developed or developing economy. Results are comparatively presented considering three well-known regression methods such as Generalized Regression Neural Network, Extreme Learning Machine and Support Vector Regression. Then the proposed approach is used to reliably estimate the missing per capita GDP of some of the war-torn and isolated countries.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a simulation testbed framework to evaluate the performance of a self-learning adaptive traffic signal control system. The core contribution of this paper is the assessment of the system’s two modes of operations (independent versus coordinated) under different congestion levels and network configurations. The insights and conclusions of the paper are based on the synergetic effect of the following: (1) appropriate design of the adaptive system parameters, (2) seamless design of generic interfaces between the adaptive system and the simulation environment using application programming interfaces, (3) rigorously calibrated simulation model and a comprehensive set of performance and environmental measures, and (4) investigation of the system components required for building a complete functioning system in the field. The system was designed and lab-tested on two case studies in the City of Burlington, Ontario. The intersections were designed and operated using the adaptive system and compared to the actuated optimized and coordinated base case timings plans. The analysis of the simulation results shows that overall the adaptive system outperforms the base case scenario by up to 25% savings in delay at the network level, and 15% reduction in CO2 emission. On the other hand, the results of the two testbed models indicate that the performance of the adaptive system varies according to the intersection conditions and flows, network configuration, traffic volume, variability in flow arrivals, and the proximity of intersections to each other.",

      "abstract": "Using agent-based modelling, this paper established an adaptive simulation model of China's wholesale electricity market with endogenous investment decisions and technical progress. The model took into account the heterogeneities of power generators, including emission reduction attitudes and risk appetites. Using this model, we simulated how carbon tax and feed-in tariff (FIT) policies will affect each single generator in terms of market behaviours (price bidding and investment) to explore the evolution of power generating portfolio and emissions differently in the time horizon 2010–2050. The validity of the model was tested according to China's electricity market data. We found that FIT for wind power and solar power will crowd out the investment in gas power and nuclear power, rather than replacing coal power. Compared to FIT, carbon tax is a more effective tool for emission abatement and incentivize multiple low carbon generating technologies. And optimal rate of carbon tax should be no more than 250 CNY/t CO2.",

They argue that ABM offers a more efficient approach to auction design than the usual mechanistic models. The authors set up the essential components of any market institution far beyond supply and demand. They build an ABM for the emissions permits auction of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), and demonstrate why the EPA failed. In the second experiment they show that in a competitive and efficient auction, the Continuous Double Auction, there is room for traders learning and strategic behavior, thus clearing the perfect market paradox. In the third experiment they build an ABM of the Spanish electricity market to get CO2 emissions prices forecasts that are more accurate than those obtained with econometric or mechanistic models.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Gas Oil Gravity Drainage (GOGD) of the Qarn Alam fractured low permeability carbonate reservoir is being enhanced by steam injection in the world's first full field development carbonate thermal development. Unlike a normal steam flood, the steam is used as a heating agent to enhance the existing gravity drainage mechanisms, and project has proved to be viable based on encouraging pilot results. The elegance of the thermally assisted - GOGD is that the fracture network is both used for distribution of steam and recovery of the oil. The number of wells can therefore be kept to a minimum compared to conventional matrix steam floods. Whereas the primary production performance of the Qarn Alam under cold GOGD is only expected to recover 3-5 % of the oil in place, studies to date indicate that the recovery factor under steam injection at 18,000 tonne per day will be in the range 20-35 % with Oil Steam Ratio of 0.16 -0.3 m3 oil /tonne of steam. The learning from the Pilot has not only helped understand the subsurface uncertainties but also provided significant insight into the engineering design and operational issues which are being managed right upfront during design. Energy consumption in the full field development of this project is reduced by banking on the benefit from co-generation of power and steam. Utilisation of co-generation will minimise CO2 emission and reduce gas import. The project will be under construction from 2007, with full rate steam injection reached by late 2009. The paper not only discusses how the project addresses the reservoir management challenges of this complex recovery mechanism but will address some of the engineering and operational challenges that are being managed.",

      "abstract": "In this two-part paper we evaluate the effect of âendogenizingâ technological learning and strategic behavior of agents in economic models used to assess climate change policies. In the first part we show the potential impact of R&amp;D policies or demonstration and deployment (D&amp;D) programs in the context of stringent stabilization scenarios. In the second part we show how game-theoretic methods can be implemented in climate change economic models to take into account three types of strategic interactions: (i) the market power of the countries benefiting from very low abatement costs on international markets for CO2 emissions, (ii) the strategic behavior of governments in the domestic allocation of CO2 emissions quotas, and (iii) the non-cooperative behavior of countries and regions in the burden sharing of CO2 concentration stabilization. The two topics of endogenous learning and game-theoretic approach to economic modeling are two manifestations of the need to take into account the strategic behavior of agents in the evaluation of climate change policies. In the first case an R&amp;D policy or a demonstration and deployment (D&amp;D) program are put in place in order to attain a cost reduction through the learning effect; in the second case the agents (countries) reply optimally to the actions decided by the other agents by exploiting their strategic advantages. Simulations based on integrated assessment models illustrate the approaches. These studies have been conducted under the Swiss NCCR-Climate program.",
