      "abstract": "Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.",

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyze the CO2 emissions and economic impacts of the implementation of the National Efficient Cooking Program (NECP) in Ecuador, which aims to migrate the population from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)-based stoves to electric induction stoves. This program is rooted in the current effort to change Ecuador's energy balance, with hydroelectric power expected to generate 83.61% of national electricity by 2022, ending the need for subsidized LPG. For this analysis, the 2014 baseline situation has been compared with two future scenarios for 2022: a business-as-usual scenario and an NECP-success scenario. This study demonstrates the viability of migration from imported fossil fuels to locally-produced renewable energy as the basis for an efficient cooking facility. The new policies scenario would save US$ 1.162 billion in annual government expenditure on cooking subsidies, and reducing CO2 emissions associated to energy for cooking in 1.8 tCO2/y.",

      "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.",

      "doi": null,
      "abstract": "The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high) datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth, emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust, emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt emotional integration.",

      "doi": "10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.08.062",
      "abstract": "Green hydrogen is essential for producing renewable fuels that are needed in sectors that are hard to electrify directly. Hydrogen production in a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant necessitates smart planning to meet long-term hydrogen trading agreements while minimising costs and emissions. Previous research analysed economic and environmental impact of hydrogen production based on full foresight of renewable energy availabilty, electricity price, and CO2 intensity in the electricity grid. However, the full foresight assumption is impractical in day-to-day operation, often leading to underestimations of both the cost and CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. Therefore, this research introduces a novel long-term planner that uses historical data and short-term forecasts to plan hydrogen production in the day-to-day operation of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant. The long-term planner co-minimises cost and CO2 emissions to determine the hydrogen production for the next day taking into account the remaining hydrogen production and the time remaining until the end of the delivery period, which can be a week, a month, or a year. Extended delivery periods provide operation flexibility, enabling cost and CO2 emissions reductions. Significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved with relatively small increases in the levelised cost. Under day-to-day operation, the levelised cost of hydrogen is marginally higher than that of the full foresight; the CO2 emissions can be up to 60% higher. Despite a significant portion of the produced hydrogen not meeting the criteria for green hydrogen designation under current rules, CO2 emissions are lower than those from existing alternative hydrogen production methods. These results underscore the importance of balancing cost considerations with environmental impacts in operational decision-making.",

      "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16265v1",
      "doi": null,
      "abstract": "The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections.",

      "doi": "10.1016/j.renene.2025.124088",
      "abstract": "Hydro-generating units (HGUs) play a crucial role in integrating intermittent renewable energy sources into the power grid due to their flexible operational capabilities. This evolving role has led to an increase in transient events, such as startups, which impose significant stresses on turbines, leading to increased turbine fatigue and a reduced operational lifespan. Consequently, optimizing startup sequences to minimize stresses is vital for hydropower utilities. However, this task is challenging, as stress measurements on prototypes can be expensive and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative automated approach to optimize the startup parameters of HGUs with a limited budget of measured startup sequences. Our method combines active learning and black-box optimization techniques, utilizing virtual strain sensors and dynamic simulations of HGUs. This approach was tested in real-time during an on-site measurement campaign on an instrumented Francis turbine prototype. The results demonstrate that our algorithm successfully identified an optimal startup sequence using only seven measured sequences. It achieves a remarkable 42% reduction in the maximum strain cycle amplitude compared to the standard startup sequence. This study paves the way for more efficient HGU startup optimization, potentially extending their operational lifespans.",

      "abstract": "Transitioning from fossil-fuel power generation to renewable energy generation and energy storage in remote locations has the potential to reduce both carbon emissions and cost. This study presents a techno-economic analysis for implementation of a hybrid renewable energy system at the South Pole in Antarctica, which currently hosts several high-energy physics experiments with nontrivial power needs. A tailored model of resource availability and economics for solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generators, lithium-ion energy storage, and long-duration energy storage at this site is explored in different combinations with and without existing diesel energy generation. The Renewable Energy Integration and Optimization (REopt) platform is used to determine the optimal system component sizing and the associated system economics and environmental benefit. We find that the least-cost system includes all three energy generation sources and lithium-ion energy storage. For an example steady-state load of 170 kW, this hybrid system includes 180 kW-DC of photovoltaic panels, 570 kW of wind turbines, and a 3.4 MWh lithium-ion battery energy storage system. This system reduces diesel consumption by 95% compared to an all-diesel configuration, resulting in approximately 1200 metric tons of carbon footprint avoided annually. Over the course of a 15-year analysis period the reduced diesel usage leads to a net savings of 57 million United States dollars, with a time to payback of approximately two years. All the scenarios modeled show that the transition to renewables is highly cost effective under the unique economics and constraints of this extremely remote site.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multi-RREH (Remote Renewable Energy Hub) based optimization framework. This framework allows a valorization of CO2 using carbon capture technologies. This valorization is grounded on the idea that CO2 gathered from the atmosphere or post combustion can be combined with hydrogen to produce synthetic methane. The hydrogen is obtained from water electrolysis using renewable energy (RE). Such renewable energy is generated in RREHs, which are locations where RE is cheap and abundant (e.g., solar PV in the Sahara Desert, or wind in Greenland). We instantiate our framework on a case study focusing on Belgium and 2 RREHs, and we conduct a techno-economic analysis. This analysis highlights the key role played by the cost of the two main carbon capture technologies: Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC) and Direct Air Capture (DAC). In addition, we use our framework to derive a carbon price threshold above which carbon capture technologies may start playing a pivotal role in the decarbonation process of our industries. For example, this price threshold may give relevant information for calibrating the EU Emission Trading System so as to trigger the emergence of the multi-RREH.",

      "abstract": "A community integrated energy system (CIES) is an important carrier of the energy internet and smart city in geographical and functional terms. Its emergence provides a new solution to the problems of energy utilization and environmental pollution. To coordinate the integrated demand response and uncertainty of renewable energy generation (RGs), a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is constructed. A comprehensive norm consisting of the 1-norm and infinity-norm is used as the uncertainty probability distribution information set, thereby avoiding complex probability density information. To address multiple uncertainties of RGs, a generative adversarial network based on the Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty is proposed to generate RG scenarios, which has wide applicability. To further tap the potential of the demand response, we take into account the ambiguity of human thermal comfort and the thermal inertia of buildings. Thus, an integrated demand response mechanism is developed that effectively promotes the consumption of renewable energy. The proposed method is simulated in an actual CIES in North China. In comparison with traditional stochastic programming and robust optimization, it is verified that the proposed DRO model properly balances the relationship between economical operation and robustness while exhibiting stronger adaptability. Furthermore, our approach outperforms other commonly used DRO methods with better operational economy, lower renewable power curtailment rate, and higher computational efficiency.",

      "doi": "10.1016/j.rser.2023.113913",
      "abstract": "Most existing data-driven power system short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) approaches presume class-balanced input data. However, in practical applications, the occurrence of short-term voltage instability following a disturbance is minimal, leading to a significant class imbalance problem and a consequent decline in classifier performance. This work proposes a Transformer-based STVSA method to address this challenge. By utilizing the basic Transformer architecture, a stability assessment Transformer (StaaT) is developed {as a classification model to reflect the correlation between the operational states of the system and the resulting stability outcomes}. To combat the negative impact of imbalanced datasets, this work employs a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP) for synthetic data generation, aiding in the creation of a balanced, representative training set for the classifier. Semi-supervised clustering learning is implemented to enhance clustering quality, addressing the lack of a unified quantitative criterion for short-term voltage stability. {Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus test system extensively demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robust performance under class imbalances up to 100:1 and noisy environments, and maintains consistent effectiveness even with an increased penetration of renewable energy}. Comparative results reveal that the CWGAN-GP generates more balanced datasets than traditional oversampling methods and that the StaaT outperforms other deep learning algorithms. This study presents a compelling solution for real-world STVSA applications that often face class imbalance and data noise challenges.",

These systems rely on robust forecasting, optimization, and control/scheduling algorithms that can handle the uncertain nature of demand and renewable generation. This paper proposes an advanced ML algorithm, called Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network based Forecast Embedded Scheduling (rTPNN-FES), to provide efficient residential demand control. rTPNN-FES is a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously forecasts renewable energy generation and schedules household appliances. By its embedded structure, rTPNN-FES eliminates the utilization of separate algorithms for forecasting and scheduling and generates a schedule that is robust against forecasting errors. This paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm for an IoT-enabled smart home. The evaluation results reveal that rTPNN-FES provides near-optimal scheduling $37.5$ times faster than the optimization while outperforming state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.",

      "abstract": "Community energy systems as decentralized and collective renewable energy systems, where the energy is jointly generated and distributed among a community of households, are gaining momentum. The collective action of individual households as a core characteristic of such energy systems influences the energy availability, energy costs, and eventually, their energy security. This study investigates the influence of individual households' behavioural attributes on the energy security of such collective energy systems. An agent-based model was built based on the following energy security dimensions: availability, affordability, accessibility and acceptability, referred to as the 4A's concept. The research focused on thermal energy communities given the considerable share of thermal energy applications, such as heating, cooling, and hot tap water. The simulation results demonstrated that such communities could cost around 1250 €/year while reducing their CO2 emissions by 50% on average. Environmentally friendly behaviour leads to higher energy security performances. Such behaviours considerably influence the technical configurations while contributing positively to affordability and acceptability dimensions of collective energy security of thermal energy systems. Furthermore, the investment size of individual households was found to be the most influential parameter for energy security performances, while natural gas prices were identified as the least impactful parameter.",

Therefore, shifting to cleaner energy sources imposes itself as an inevitable solution to reduce this environmental cost. In this paper, a hybrid system based on the multi-agent approach and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast the energy production and its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and simulate the potential emission reduction in case of switching to renewable energy sources is presented. The proposed system's architecture consists of combining LSTM models with the agent-based technology, where multiple LSTM forecasting models were trained to forecast the production of each type of the studied energies and then estimate the equivalent emitted CO2 and calculate the influence of the renewable energy inputs on the carbon emissions and the fossil fuels consumption. The simulation process consists of two phases: firstly, each forecasting agent uses a specific LSTM model to forecast short-term energy production. Secondly, these agents send the forecasted values to the coordination agent who is responsible for calculating the total CO2 emissions and the benefits of the renewable energy inputs.",

      "abstract": "Power markets are becoming increasingly complex as they move towards (i) integrating higher amounts of variable renewable energy, (ii) shorter trading intervals and lead times, (iii) stronger interdependencies between related markets, and (iv) increasing energy system integration. For designing them appropriately, an enhanced understanding of the dynamics in interrelated short-term physical power and energy markets is required, which can be supported by market simulations. In this paper, we present an agent-based power market simulation model with rule-based bidding strategies that addresses the above-mentioned challenges, and represents market participants individually with a high level of technical detail. By allowing agents to participate in several interrelated markets, such as the energy-only market, a procurement platform for control reserve and a local heat market representing district heating systems, cross-market opportunity costs are well reflected. With this approach, we were able to reproduce EPEX SPOT market outcomes for the German bidding zone with a high level of accuracy (mean absolute percentage error of 8 €/MWh for the years 2016–2019). We were also able to model negative market prices at the energy-only market realistically, and observed that the occurrence of negative prices differs among data inputs used. The simulation model provides a useful tool for investigating different short-term physical power/energy market structures and designs in the future. The modular structure also enables extension to further related markets, such as fuel, CO2, or derivative markets.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart meters devices in smart grids is providing key support for measuring and analyzing the power consumption patterns. This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures. &copy; 2022 IEEE.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Owing to large industrial energy consumption, industrial production has brought a huge burden to the grid in terms of renewable energy access and power supply. Due to the coupling of multiple energy sources and the uncertainty of renewable energy and demand, centralized methods require large calculation and coordination overhead. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-energy management framework achieved by decentralized execution and centralized training for an industrial park. The energy management problem is formulated as a partially-observable Markov decision process, which is intractable by dynamic programming due to the lack of the prior knowledge of the underlying stochastic process. The objective is to minimize long-term energy costs while ensuring the demand of users. To solve this issue and improve the calculation speed, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, which contains the following key points: counterfactual baseline for facilitating contributing agents to learn better policies, soft actor-critic for improving robustness and exploring optimal solutions. A novel reward is designed by Lagrange multiplier method to ensure the capacity constraints of energy storage. In addition, considering that the increase in the number of agents leads to performance degradation due to large observation spaces, an attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the stability of policy and enable agents to focus on important energy-related information, which improves the exploration efficiency of soft actor-critic. Numerical results based on actual data verify the performance of the proposed algorithm with high scalability, indicating that the industrial park can minimize energy costs under different demands.",

      "doi": null,
      "abstract": "Governments' net zero emission target aims at increasing the share of renewable energy sources as well as influencing the behaviours of consumers to support the cost-effective balancing of energy supply and demand. These will be achieved by the advanced information and control infrastructures of smart grids which allow the interoperability among various stakeholders. Under this circumstance, increasing number of consumers produce, store, and consume energy, giving them a new role of prosumers. The integration of prosumers and accommodation of incurred bidirectional flows of energy and information rely on two key factors: flexible structures of energy markets and intelligent operations of power systems. The blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are innovative technologies to fulfil these two factors, by which the blockchain provides decentralised trading platforms for energy markets and the AI supports the optimal operational control of power systems. This paper attempts to address how to incorporate the blockchain and AI in the smart grids for facilitating prosumers to participate in energy markets. To achieve this objective, first, this paper reviews how policy designs price carbon emissions caused by the fossil-fuel based generation so as to facilitate the integration of prosumers with renewable energy sources. Second, the potential structures of energy markets with the support of the blockchain technologies are discussed. Last, how to apply the AI for enhancing the state monitoring and decision making during the operations of power systems is introduced.",

      "abstract": "Calibrating agent-based models (ABMs) to data is among the most fundamental requirements to ensure the model fulfils its desired purpose. In recent years, simulation-based inference methods have emerged as powerful tools for performing this task when the model likelihood function is intractable, as is often the case for ABMs. In some real-world use cases of ABMs, both the observed data and the ABM output consist of the agents' states and their interactions over time. In such cases, there is a tension between the desire to make full use of the rich information content of such granular data on the one hand, and the need to reduce the dimensionality of the data to prevent difficulties associated with high-dimensional learning tasks on the other. A possible resolution is to construct lower-dimensional time-series through the use of summary statistics describing the macrostate of the system at each time point. However, a poor choice of summary statistics can result in an unacceptable loss of information from the original dataset, dramatically reducing the quality of the resulting calibration. In this work, we instead propose to learn parameter posteriors associated with granular microdata directly using temporal graph neural networks. We will demonstrate that such an approach offers highly compelling inductive biases for Bayesian inference using the raw ABM microstates as output.",

      "abstract": "Communication is an effective mechanism for coordinating the behaviors of multiple agents, broadening their views of the environment, and to support their collaborations. In the field of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can improve the overall learning performance and achieve their objectives by communication. Agents can communicate various types of messages, either to all agents or to specific agent groups, or conditioned on specific constraints. With the growing body of research work in MADRL with communication (Comm-MADRL), there is a lack of a systematic and structural approach to distinguish and classify existing Comm-MADRL approaches. In this paper, we survey recent works in the Comm-MADRL field and consider various aspects of communication that can play a role in designing and developing multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. With these aspects in mind, we propose 9 dimensions along which Comm-MADRL approaches can be analyzed, developed, and compared. By projecting existing works into the multi-dimensional space, we discover interesting trends. We also propose some novel directions for designing future Comm-MADRL systems through exploring possible combinations of the dimensions.",

      "abstract": "The total electricity consumption from offshore oil/gas platforms is around 16 TWh worldwide in 2019. The majority offshore platforms are powered by the diesel generators while the rest mainly uses gas turbines, which emits large amounts of CO2 per year. The fast development of offshore wind turbines (WT) can potentially replace traditional fossil fuel based resources to power offshore loads. Thus, a novel offshore hybrid renewable energy sources (OHRES) system is proposed to enable a zero CO2 emission offshore platform mitigating climate change. Battery energy storage system (BESS) and hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) are considered to mitigate the fluctuation of wind power in the proposed OHRES system. Resilience models are designed to enhance the resilience of the proposed OHRES system with extra energy stored in BESS and/or HESS. Case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed OHRES system to power offshore platforms. The economic analysis reports the planning cost for the proposed OHRES system under different resilience levels, which may benefit the decision to balance the carbon emission and investment cost.",

Cooperating agents learn to control the flexibility offered by electric vehicles, space heating and flexible loads in a partially observable stochastic environment. In the standard independent Q-learning approach, the coordination performance of agents under partial observability drops at scale in stochastic environments. Here, the novel combination of learning from off-line convex optimisations on historical data and isolating marginal contributions to total rewards in reward signals increases stability and performance at scale. Using fixed-size Q-tables, prosumers are able to assess their marginal impact on total system objectives without sharing personal data either with each other or with a central coordinator. Case studies are used to assess the fitness of different combinations of exploration sources, reward definitions, and multi-agent learning frameworks. It is demonstrated that the proposed strategies create value at individual and system levels thanks to reductions in the costs of energy imports, losses, distribution network congestion, battery depreciation and greenhouse gas emissions.",

Forecasting the environmental cost of energy production is necessary for better decision making and easing the switch to cleaner energy systems in order to reduce air pollution. This paper describes a hybrid approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and an agent-based architecture for forecasting carbon dioxide (CO2) issued from different energy sources in the city of Annaba using real data. The system consists of multiple autonomous agents, divided into two types: firstly, forecasting agents, which forecast the production of a particular type of energy using the ANN models; secondly, core agents that perform other essential functionalities such as calculating the equivalent CO2 emissions and controlling the simulation. The development is based on Algerian gas and electricity data provided by the national energy company. The simulation consists firstly of forecasting energy production using the forecasting agents and calculating the equivalent emitted CO2. Secondly, a dedicated agent calculates the total CO2 emitted from all the available sources. It then computes the benefits of using renewable energy sources as an alternative way to meet the electric load in terms of emission mitigation and economizing natural gas consumption. The forecasting models showed satisfying results, and the simulation scenario showed that using renewable energy can help reduce the emissions by 369 tons of CO2 (3%) per day.",

Hydrogen development should also meet the seventh goal of ‘affordable and clean energy’ of the United Nations. Here we review hydrogen production and life cycle analysis, hydrogen geological storage and hydrogen utilisation. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis, steam methane reforming, methane pyrolysis and coal gasification. We compare the environmental impact of hydrogen production routes by life cycle analysis. Hydrogen is used in power systems, transportation, hydrocarbon and ammonia production, and metallugical industries. Overall, combining electrolysis-generated hydrogen with hydrogen storage in underground porous media such as geological reservoirs and salt caverns is well suited for shifting excess off-peak energy to meet dispatchable on-peak demand.",

      "abstract": "In order to balance the interests of integrated energy operator (IEO) and users, a novel Stackelberg game-based optimization framework is proposed for the optimal scheduling of integrated demand response (IDR)-enabled integrated energy systems with uncertain renewable generations, where the IEO acts as the leader who pursues the maximization of his profits by setting energy prices, while the users are the follower who adjusts energy consumption plans to minimize their energy costs. Taking into account the inherent uncertainty of renewable generations, the probabilistic spinning reserve is written in the form of a chance constraint; in addition, a district heating network model is built considering the characteristics of time delay and thermal attenuation by fully exploiting its potential, and the flexible thermal comfort requirements of users in IDR are considered by introducing a predicted mean vote (PMV) index. To solve the raised model, sequence operation theory is introduced to convert the chance constraint into its deterministic equivalent form, and thereby, the leader-follower Stackelberg game is tackled into a mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and is finally solved by the CPLEX optimizer. The results of two case studies demonstrate that the proposed Stackelberg game-based approach manages to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium between IEO and users by the coordination of renewable generations and IDR. Furthermore, the study on a real integrated energy system in China verifies the applicability of the proposed approach for real-world applications.",

However, even after solving the critical research challenges, engineering and materials science will still impose significant constraints on the characteristics of a fusion power plant. Meanwhile, the global energy grid must transition to low-carbon sources by 2050 to prevent the worst effects of climate change. We review three factors affecting fusion's future trajectory: (1) the significant drop in the price of renewable energy, (2) the intermittency of renewable sources and implications for future energy grids, and (3) the recent proposition of intermediate-level nuclear waste as a product of fusion. Within the scenario assumed by our premises, we find that while there remains a clear motivation to develop fusion power plants, this motivation is likely weakened by the time they become available. We also conclude that most current fusion reactor designs do not take these factors into account and, to increase market penetration, fusion research should consider relaxed nuclear waste design criteria, raw material availability constraints and load-following designs with pulsed operation.",

      "abstract": "A community integrated energy system (CIES) with an electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) provides a new way for tackling growing concerns of energy efficiency and environmental pollution, it is a critical task to coordinate flexible demand response and multiple renewable uncertainties. To this end, a novel bi-level optimal dispatching model for the CIES with an EVCS in multi-stakeholder scenarios is established in this paper. In this model, an integrated demand response program is designed to promote a balance between energy supply and demand while maintaining a user comprehensive satisfaction within an acceptable range. To further tap the potential of demand response through flexibly guiding users' energy consumption and electric vehicles' behaviors (charging, discharging and providing spinning reserves), a dynamic pricing mechanism combining time-of-use and real-time pricing is put forward. In the solution phase, by using sequence operation theory (SOT), the original chance-constrained programming (CCP) model is converted into a readily solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and finally solved by CPLEX solver. The simulation results on a practical CIES located in North China demonstrate that the presented method manages to balance the interests between CIES and EVCS via the coordination of flexible demand response and uncertain renewables.",

      "abstract": "The ambitious energy target to achieve climate-neutrality in the European Union (EU) energy system raises the feasibility question of using only renewables across all energy sectors. As one of the EU's leading industrialized countries, Germany has adopted several climate-action plans for the realistic implementation and maximum utilization of renewable energies in its energy system. The literature review shows a clear gap in comprehensive techniques describing an open modeling approach for analyzing fully renewable and sector-coupled energy systems. This paper outlines a method for analyzing the 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled energy system's feasibility in Germany. Based on the open energy modeling framework, an hourly optimization tool 'OSeEM-DE' is developed to investigate the German energy system. The model results show that a 100% renewable-based and sector-coupled system for electricity and building heat is feasible in Germany. The investment capacities and component costs depend on the parametric variations of the developed scenarios. The annual investment costs vary between 17.6 and 26.6 bn Euro/yr for volatile generators and between 23.7 and 28.8 bn Euro/yr for heat generators. The model suggests an investment of a minimum of 2.7-3.9 bn Euro/yr for electricity and heat storage. Comparison of OSeEM-DE results with recent studies validates the percentage-wise energy mix composition and the calculated Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values from the model. Sensitivity analyses indicate that storage and grid expansion maximize the system's flexibility and decrease the investment cost. The study concludes by showing how the tool can analyze different energy systems in the EU context.",

      "abstract": "Insufficient flexibility in system operation caused by traditional \"heat-set\" operating modes of combined heat and power (CHP) units in winter heating periods is a key issue that limits renewable energy consumption. In order to reduce the curtailment of renewable energy resources through improving the operational flexibility, a novel optimal scheduling model based on chance-constrained programming (CCP), aiming at minimizing the lowest generation cost, is proposed for a small-scale integrated energy system (IES) with CHP units, thermal power units, renewable generations and representative auxiliary equipments. In this model, due to the uncertainties of renewable generations including wind turbines and photovoltaic units, the probabilistic spinning reserves are supplied in the form of chance-constrained; from the perspective of user experience, a heating load model is built with consideration of heat comfort and inertia in buildings. To solve the model, a solution approach based on sequence operation theory (SOT) is developed, where the original CCP-based scheduling model is tackled into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by converting a chance constraint into its deterministic equivalence class, and thereby is solved via the CPLEX solver. The simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that the presented method manages to improve operational flexibility of the IES with uncertain renewable generations by comprehensively leveraging thermal inertia of buildings and different kinds of auxiliary equipments, which provides a fundamental way for promoting renewable energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "Modelling and computational methods have been essential in advancing quantitative science, especially in the past two decades with the availability of vast amount of complex, voluminous, and heterogeneous data. In particular, there has been a surge of interest in agent-based modelling, largely due to its capabilities to exploit such data and make significant projections. However, any well-established quantitative method relies on theoretical frameworks for both construction and analysis. While the computational aspects of agent-based modelling have been detailed in existing literature, the underlying theoretical basis has rarely been used in its construction. In this exposition, we provide an overview of the theoretical foundation of agent-based modelling and establish a relationship with its computational implementation. In addition to detailing the main characteristics of this computational methodology, we illustrate its application to simulating the spread of an infectious disease in a simple, dynamical process. As the use of agent-based models expands to various disciplines, our review highlights the need for directed research efforts to develop theoretical methods and analytical tools for the analysis of such models.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, inertia in power systems has been determined by considering all the rotating masses directly connected to the grid. During the last decade, the integration of renewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic installations and wind power plants, has led to a significant dynamic characteristic change in power systems. This change is mainly due to the fact that most renewables have power electronics at the grid interface. The overall impact on stability and reliability analysis of power systems is very significant. The power systems become more dynamic and require a new set of strategies modifying traditional generation control algorithms. Indeed, renewable generation units are decoupled from the grid by electronic converters, decreasing the overall inertia of the grid. 'Hidden inertia', 'synthetic inertia' or 'virtual inertia' are terms currently used to represent artificial inertia created by converter control of the renewable sources. Alternative spinning reserves are then needed in the new power system with high penetration renewables, where the lack of rotating masses directly connected to the grid must be emulated to maintain an acceptable power system reliability. This paper reviews the inertia concept in terms of values and their evolution in the last decades, as well as the damping factor values. A comparison of the rotational grid inertia for traditional and current averaged generation mix scenarios is also carried out. In addition, an extensive discussion on wind and photovoltaic power plants and their contributions to inertia in terms of frequency control strategies is included in the paper.",

Energy system design is, however, challenged by real-world objective functions consisting of a blurry mix of technical and socioeconomic agendas, with limitations that cannot always be clearly stated. As a result, it is highly likely that solutions which are techno-economically suboptimal will be preferable. Here, we present a method capable of determining the continuum containing all techno-economically near-optimal solutions, moving the field of energy system modeling from discrete solutions to a new era where continuous solution ranges are available. The presented method is applied to study a range of technical and socioeconomic metrics on a model of the European electricity system. The near-optimal region is found to be relatively flat allowing for solutions that are slightly more expensive than the optimum but better in terms of equality, land use, and implementation time.",

However, this is not as simple as instantaneously closing down all fossil fuel energy generation and replacing them with renewable sources -- careful decisions need to be taken to ensure rapid but stable progress. To aid decision makers, we present a new tool, ElecSim, which is an open-sourced agent-based modelling framework used to examine the effect of policy on long-term investment decisions in electricity generation. ElecSim allows non-experts to rapidly prototype new ideas. Different techniques to model long-term electricity decisions are reviewed and used to motivate why agent-based models will become an important strategic tool for policy. We motivate why an open-source toolkit is required for long-term electricity planning. Actual electricity prices are compared with our model and we demonstrate that the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation in the system improves performance by $52.5\\%$. Further, using ElecSim we demonstrate the effect of a carbon tax to encourage a low-carbon electricity supply. We show how a {\\pounds}40 ($\\$50$) per tonne of CO2 emitted would lead to 70% renewable electricity by 2050.",

Thus the key point is to develop low-cost, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for CO2RR. To benefit from their exposed active sites and to maximize atomic efficiency, single-metal atom catalysts that usually show high activities are required. Herein, we unravel the trends in the reactivity and selectivity of atomically isolated M–N4 (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) sites within porous porphyrinic triazine framework (metal single atoms/PTF) for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. We found that NiSAs/PTF exhibited the highest faradaic efficiency (98%) at a mild potential of −0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and the highest turnover frequency of 13,462 h−1 for the production CO at an applied potential of −1.2 V. The relations of catalytic performance of CO2 to CO over the different active M–N4 sites were unraveled by the combination of density functional theory calculations and experiments. This work gives an extensive mechanistic understanding of the selectivity of CO2 to CO from the M–N4 sites at an atomic scale, thus it will bring new inspiration for the design of highly efficient CO2RR. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction The large-scale use of fossil fuels has led to a substantial increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, hence causing environmental problems, including global warming and sea-level rise.1–3 Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value-added chemicals and fuels using renewable electricity is a promising strategy to balance the global carbon emission.4–6 Among the electroreduction products, CO is considered one of the most valuable industrial feedstocks, which can be used for the catalytic Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to produce hydrocarbon liquid fuels.7,8 Fortunately, compared with other CO2RR processes, the reduction of CO2 to CO [CO2 + 2H++ 2e− → CO + H2O, −0.11 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] needs only two electron/proton transfers,9 which makes it an essentially less-hindered pathway.10 Nevertheless, due to the low energetic efficiency, sluggish electron transfer kinetic, poor selectivity, and low stability of electrode materials significant challenges remain that impede the practical use and technological commercialization result from the inert chemical bond of CO2 (C = O, 806 kJ·mol−1)11 and the accompanied competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).12,13 Furthermore, the high cost and scarcity of noble metal catalysts, such as Au- and Ag-based catalysts, limit their large-scale applications.14,15 Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficient earth-abundant metal-based electrocatalysts specifically for CO2 to CO conversion with long durability to meet the practical application. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically isolated metal atoms anchored on supports usually show high activity and selectivity toward various catalytic performances because of their maximum atom efficiency, exposed active sites, and tunable coordination microenvironment.16–18 Thus, SACs anchored on conductive materials such as porous carbons and graphene have displayed great potential to enhance their performance in CO2RR.19–22 However, the preparation of stable and highly efficient SACs remains a great challenge because of the high surface energy of their single atoms and easy formation of inactive aggregates.23,24 Moreover, mechanistic understanding of the relationships between the CO2RR reactivity and the structures of SACs is still elusive, which impedes further designing of highly efficient SACs for the CO2RR.25–27 Porous covalent triazine frameworks constructed by 1,3,5-triazine linkers have attracted much attention in gas adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis because of their high specific surface area, high nitrogen contents, and remarkable acid/base stability.28–30 Recently, our group reported that the porphyrin architectures stabilized Fe/Co single atoms within porphyrinic triazine frameworks (PTF), which can behave as accessible active sites for highly efficient electrocatalysis for oxygen reduction reaction and HER.31,32 Herein, a series of atomically isolated M–N4 sites anchored on highly porous porphyrinic triazine framework [metal single atoms (MSAs)/PTF, M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co] were prepared and employed as electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Among these single-atom metal elements, Ni material, NiSAs/PTF, was found to have a very high faradaic efficiency (FE), between 94% and 98% for CO generation over a wide range of applied potential (−0.6 to −1.2 V) versus RHE (RHE scale was used as a reference for all applied potential scales). Impressively, NiSAs/PTF reached a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 13,462 h−1 at a mild applied potential of −1.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that NiSAs/PTF and FeSAs/PTF have more positive estimated electrochemical limiting potentials than those of CoSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF. The rate determining step for NiSAs/PTF, CoSAs/PTF, and CuSAs/PTF is the *COOH intermediate formation, whereas, with FeSAs/PTF, it is the last step of CO desorption that seemed to be rate determining. Furthermore, the CO2RR occurs easier than the HER over the coordinately unsaturated Ni–N4 site in NiSAs/PTF. Results and Discussion The atomically isolated Ni–N4 and Cu–N4 sites anchored by porphyrin moieties within porous porphyrinic triazine framework (denoted as NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, respectively) were prepared via a one-pot ionothermal trimerization reaction of the corresponding 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-cyanophenyl)porphyrinato]-M (M-TPPCN, M = Ni, Cu), catalyzed by the molten zinc chloride as Lewis acid at 600 °C for 40 h (Figure 1). After washing with diluted hydrochloric acid for NiSAs/PTF or nitric acid for CuSAs/PTF, followed by deionized water and ethanol, black powder samples were obtained after oven drying in vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. The FeSAs/PTF and CoSAs/PTF materials containing single-atom sites of Fe–N4 and Co–N4, were prepared respectively, according to a previously reported method.31,32 The polymerization reaction and formation of polytriazine networks were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared analysis (). The disappearance of the carbonitrile stretching band at ca. 2225 cm−1 demonstrated that the conversion of the monomers M-TPPCN (M = Ni, Cu) was completed successfully. Meanwhile, a strong absorption band at 1587 cm−1 assigned to triazine rings was observed, indicating the success of the trimerization reaction.33,34 Figure 1 | Schematic illustration of the fabrication of MSAs/PTF (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Download figure Download PowerPoint The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF (Figure 2a) are similar to those of Fe- and CoSAs/PTF,31,32 indicating that all the MSAs/PTF have amorphous structures. A prominent wide peak, centered at ca. 25.6° was apparent, which could be assigned to the amorphous (001) reflection of aromatic sheets.35 In addition, a weak peak at ca. 43.0° corresponding to the appearance of (101) reflection of graphitic carbon, and also, indicated that their graphitization occurred at 600 °C. Notably, there was no evidence of an appearance of diffraction peak relative to metal-based particles or carbides. Strikingly, the results obtained from the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy () revealed that the samples NiSAs/PTF, CuSAs/PTF, FeSAs/PTF, and CoSAs/PTF have high corresponding metal contents of 1.11, 0.82, 2.60, and 0.85 wt%, respectively. Thus, we deduced that these metals may possess an atomic-level distribution and that single-atom metals were successfully embedded in the PTFs. The Raman spectra (Figure 2b) also showed no peak of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, as they were similar to the Fe- and CoSAs/PTF samples.31,32 Moreover, these samples have high IG/ID ratios (where IG and ID represent the G-band and D-band intensity, respectively) and a broad weak two-dimensional (2D) peak at ca. 2800 cm−1, suggesting that partial graphitization phenomenon had occurred and graphitic layered structures were presented in the catalysts. The Nyquist plots from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for the MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu, Co, and Fe) further demonstrated that these materials have small semicircles (Figure 2c and ), and that the partial graphitized structures are beneficial for improving the electron transfer rate between the interfaces of the catalyst and the electrolyte, thus enhancing CO2RR activity. Figure 2 | (a) PXRD patterns, (b) Raman spectra of NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, (c) Nyquist plots, and (d) CO2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 273 K for FeSAs/PTF, CoSAs/PTF, NiSAs/PTF, and CuSAs/PTF. Download figure Download PowerPoint The nitrogen adsorption measurements revealed that all the MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) samples have high N2 adsorption uptake and large Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas in the range of 454–873 m2 g−1 (). Moreover, distinct hysteresis loops were observed at the P/Po range of 0.45–1.0, indicating meso- and/or macropores were formed in all the MSAs/PTF materials, attributed to the porogenic agent zinc chloride.36 The pore size distributions based on the nonlocal DFT method () for the MSAs/PTF family further revealed that their pores are in the range of 0.7–9.9 nm. The hierarchically porous structure could imply that the single-atom metal active sites are highly accessible to the reactive species and electrolytes, thus facilitating mass transportation and improving energy conversion efficiency. The CO2 adsorption isotherms further revealed that all the MSAs/PTF materials have large adsorption capacities, ranging from 52–97 cm3 g−1 at 273 K (Figure 2d), illustrating that there was a strong interaction between these nitrogen-rich MSAs/PTF materials and CO2 molecules, which, in turn, enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of CO2RR. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM with subangstrom resolution measurements were further used to confirm the atomic levels of the metal sites. As shown in the TEM (Figure 3a and ) and HAADF-STEM (Figure 3d and ) images of the NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, no obvious NPs were observed, a finding which is consistent with their PXRD (Figure 2a) and Raman results (Figure 2b). Notably, the TEM element mapping images (Figure 3c and ) show that Ni and Cu elements are uniformly distributed at atomic-level throughout the architecture of NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF, respectively. In addition, a large number of bright spots related with the heavier Ni and Cu elements with atomic dispersion could be seen in the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images for NiSAs/PTF (Figure 3b) and CuSAs/PTF (), respectively.37–42 These results suggested that single-atom metal sites within NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF have been fabricated successfully. Figure 3 | (a) TEM images of NiSAs/PTF. (b) Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images showing the atomic dispersion of Ni in NiSAs/PTF. HAADF image (c) and corresponding C, N, and Ni EDS elemental mapping. Download figure Download PowerPoint In order to confirm the local chemical environment of single-atom metals, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was first employed. As shown in , the N 1s signal band of all the MSAs/PTF materials split into three-type configurations, originating from triazinic N (398.5 eV), porphyrinic-like metal-coordinated M–Nx (399.7 eV), and graphitic N (401.1 eV) species.43,44 The high-resolution metal 2p XPS spectra of MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu) are displayed in . As shown in the fitted Ni 2p spectrum, two dominated peaks were centered at 855.4 eV (2p3/2) and 872.5 eV (2p1/2), similar to those of Ni2+ in Ni-TPPCN (855.3 and 872.6 eV, ), but higher than the Ni(0) metal (854.3 and 871.9 eV).45 The Fe 2p3/2 and Co 2p3/2 are 709.6 and 780.6 eV, which are near to those of Fe2+ and Co2+, respectively.31,32 As for CuSAs/PTF, the dominating signals at binding energies of 935.8 eV (2p3/2) and 955.9 eV (2p1/2) are originated from the positive Cu–N bond.46,47 These results revealed that all the metals are significantly positive, implying that no metal NPs were detected,48 which are in good agreement with PXRD (Figure 2a) and the TEM results (Figure 3a). Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy was further performed to confirm the coordination environment of these single-atom metals in MSAs/PTF. As shown in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of the Ni K-edge in NiSAs/PTF (Figure 4a), both of the pre-edge and absorption edge energy position of NiSAs/PTF are located in between Ni foil and NiO, indicating that the Ni single atoms carried positive charges between metallic Ni(0) and the fully oxidized states Ni(II),49 consistent with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) () and electron paramagnetic resonance results ().50 Moreover, a weak pre-edge peak (A position) at ca. 8330 eV appeared in NiSAs/PTF, and the precursor Ni-TPPCN was attributed to the dipole-forbidden but quadrupole-allowed transition (1s → 3d), which suggested that hybridization of 3d and 4p orbitals of the Ni central atoms had occurred.9 Additionally, a strong peak at ca. 8336 eV (peak B) was observed in both of NiSAs/PTF and the precursor Ni-TPPCN, which was due to the 1s → 4pz transition. These transitions serve as fingerprints for square-planar configuration with D4h centrosymmetry, and confirm that the NiSAs/PTF contains Ni–N4 porphyrin-like moieties originating from the Ni-TPPCN monomer. Furthermore, the relatively larger intensity ratio for peaks C and D than Ni-TPPCN, in which the two peaks are associated with the 1s → 4px,y transitions and multiple scattering processes, respectively, are expected to show good electrocatalytic performances. In addition, the Ni L-edge XANES spectrum () of NiSAs/PTF displayed a distinctive single peak related to 3d-electrons at the L3-edge, which is similar to Ni rather than Ni-based oxides.51 The N K-edge of the XANES spectrum of NiSAs/PTF () shows a resonance peak of the π*-transition pyrrolic-N that bonded to Ni atoms to form Ni–Nx species. The formation of Ni–Nx was confirmed further by the observation of weak π* peak assigned to sp2-hybridized carbon of C–N–Ni in C K-edge of NiSAs/PTF ().

Download figure Download PowerPoint For the XANES spectrum of CuSAs/PTF, its absorption edge energy was positioned between Cu foil and Cu(II)-TPPCN (Figure 4b), suggesting partial Cu atoms in CuSAs/PTF had been reduced to Cu(I). A similar phenomenon was also found in FeSAs/PTF, in which the Fe atoms have been reduced to Fe(II) from Fe(III) of Fe-TPPCN at high synthesis temperature.31 Moreover, the pre-edge peak at 8985 eV was similar to the monomer Cu-TPPCN, which is associated with 1s → 4pz shakedown transition feature for a square-planar configuration with high D4h symmetry structure. These results indicated that Cu–N4 porphyrin-like structure predominates in CuSAs/PTF, which is similar to that of NiSAs/PTF, FeSAs/PTF, and CoSAs/PTF.31,32 Concurrently, in the Fourier-transform, k3-weighted χ(k) function of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for NiSAs/PTF (Figure 4c) exhibited a strong major peak at 1.44 Å associated with Ni–N/O, which is similar to the monomer Ni-TPPCN (1.47 Å), suggesting that the Ni atoms coordinated with N elements. Furthermore, no obvious peak at the positions of Ni foil was observed for NiSAs/PTF sample, indicating that no Ni–Ni bond was presented in NiSAs/PTF. These results suggested that no Ni NP was formed, and all Ni sites were in atomically isolated form, which is also consistent with the PXRD and aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM results. In addition, the fitting results from EXAFS analysis in Figure 4e showed that the coordination number of Ni species in NiSAs/PTF is ca. 4.0 (), suggesting that the Ni porphyrin-like structure was retained, which agreed well with the XANES results (Figure 4a). The same analysis for CuSAs/PTF (Figure 4d) also revealed that Cu NPs were absent, and the single copper atoms adopted identical coordination configuration to NiSAs/PTF with Cu–N4 structure (Figure 4f and ), which was similar to the Fe–N4 and Co–N4 in FeSAs/PTF and CoSAs/PTF.31,32 Inspired by the unique structures of these MSAs/PTF (M = Ni, Cu, Fe, and Co) materials, their activities relative to CO2RR were then evaluated by observing their performance in a gas-tight H-type electrochemical cell, separated by a Nafion-117 proton exchange membrane. The comparison of the CO2RR activities of these materials is summarized in Figure 5. As shown in the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves in Figure 5a, it was apparent that at CO2-saturated (1 atm), 0.5 M KHCO3, all the MSAs/PTF materials exhibited much more positive onset potentials and higher current densities than those in N2-saturated, 0.5 M KHCO3, suggesting that their activities might have originated from CO2 reduction. CoSAs/PTF exhibited a small onset potential of which was much more positive than that of FeSAs/PTF NiSAs/PTF and CuSAs/PTF V) (Figure Figure | (a) in the CO2-saturated and 0.5 M at a rate of (b) CO current density of MSAs/PTF at various (c) at various applied (d) at various applied Download figure Download PowerPoint The reduced and for these catalysts at different potentials within 0.5 h are displayed in Figure Notably, no liquid was found in spectroscopy and the CO and were by gas in the applied potential range between and −1.2 V versus a of was found using FeSAs/PTF electrode ().

Those benefits include the better environmental issue such as lower emission, variated feedstock and higher energy recovery, including hydrogen and waste heat. Waste to energy technology is developed as a means of waste management to obtain new and renewable energy, due to the increasingly amount of waste produced by the growing population. The feedstock use is municipal solid waste (MSW) from TPA Jatibarang in Semarang City, Central Java. Along with population growth, energy supply becoming a very crucial issue in the near future. Converting the waste to energy would overcome the two crucial issues at once. With high temperature, the plasma gas decompose the feedstock into its constituent element and within thermochemical equilibrium stoichiometry, the syngas was formed. This model was developed based on plasma arc technology and able to estimate the syngas composition, energy required for the reaction and also the CO2 emission. This study is to obtain the crucial parameter which was involved to get the highest of hydrogen, highest syngas yield, highest efficiencies along with lowest its emission.

Specifically, the paper focuses on the area of EU28 and Switzerland and uses as basis for the analysis, data estimating the potential of renewable energy sources collected and elaborated in the framework of the project HotMaps (Horizon 2020). The method used to group the territorial units is cluster analysis, and specifically the k-means algorithm. The data present some interesting patterns and the territories of EU28 and Switzerland at NUTS3 level are classified into 17 clusters. The analysis shows the presence of heterogeneity within national borders and among territories comprised in the macro regions target of specific EU programmes, specifically the Adriatic-Ionian region, the Alpine region, the Baltic Sea region and the Danube region. The results of this research are meant to be used by European policy makers in developing more focused transnational renewable energy policies and strategies.",

      "abstract": "Reducing atmospheres have recently emerged as a promising scenario to warm the surface of early Mars enough to drive the formation of valley networks and other ancient aqueous features that have been detected so far on the surface of Mars. Here we present a series of experiments and calculations to better constrain CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 collision-induced absorptions (CIAs) as well as their effect on the prediction of early Mars surface temperature. First, we carried out a new set of experimental measurements (using the AILES line of the SOLEIL synchrotron) of both CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 CIAs. These measurements confirm the previous results of Turbet et al. 2019, Icarus vol. 321, while significantly reducing the experimental uncertainties. Secondly, we fitted a semi-empirical model to these CIAs measurements, allowing us to compute the CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 CIAs across a broad spectral domain (0-1500cm-1) and for a wide range of temperatures (100-600K). Last, we performed 1-D numerical radiative-convective climate calculations (using the LMD Generic Model) to compute the surface temperature expected on the surface of early Mars for several CO2, CH4 and H2 atmospheric contents, taking into account the radiative effect of these revised CIAs. These calculations demonstrate that thick CO2+H2-dominated atmospheres remain a viable solution for warming the surface of Mars above the melting point of water, but not CO2+CH4-dominated atmospheres. Our calculated CO2+CH4 and CO2+H2 CIA spectra and predicted early Mars surface temperatures are provided to the community for future uses.",

      "abstract": "An important aspect of any scientific approach to sustainability must be methods by which the impacts of possible innovations can be assessed. Clearly, we need to make massive changes in our lifestyles if we are to get anywhere near ‘sustainability’. In this paper, an ‘agent-based model’ is developed which for this initial presentation explores probable impacts on household consumption and emissions of possible innovations. The model randomly picks a large number (here 10,000, but it can be much larger) of households from four different countries and calculates the effects resulting from the adoption of specific innovations. The ‘lifestyle’ of the households within the area studied is divided into four different ‘domains’. These are living, food, mobility and energy. Innovations are launched in the four different domains and the model shows the overall effects on the total input requirements (materials, energy, etc.), the household and food wastes and the CO2 emissions, showing how far the system moves towards sustainability. By using the sustainability criteria of 8000 kg ‘input material’ per year per individual developed by the Wuppertal Institute (Lettenmeier et al. in Resources 3:488–515, 2014, https://doi.org/10.3390/resources3030488, http://www.mdpi.com/journal/resources, ISSN 2079-9276), we can calculate how far the nation or region is from sustainability after adopting possible innovations. This is a measure of the total inputs required per individual per year. It allows us to show that for different countries, with widely different climates (e.g. Finland and Spain), different household innovations would have a greater or lesser impact on attaining ‘sustainable lifestyles’. The model does not pretend to develop a full simulation of each system, including the ecosystem, type of economy, etc., but does look at the effect an innovation in one household domain will have on all four domains, thereby providing information that can improve current decisions. It also demonstrates that, although ‘households’ can do much to improve the situation by reducing their demand for energy and materials, some actions at a national/regional level will be required to achieve sustainability. For example, sustainability will require an end to the use of fossil fuels for transportation and a switch to ‘clean’ electrical power generation from renewables and nuclear sources. Without this change, these countries will find it impossible to reach a sustainable lifestyle.",

      "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2018.06.222",
      "abstract": "There are two competing concepts in the literature for the integration of high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of continent-wide transmission networks. In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.",

      "abstract": "The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures.",

The influence of three parameters is investigated on the conversion: the CO2 and CH4 flow rates, the plasma power and the nature of the carrier gas (argon or helium). The energy efficiency of the CO2 conversion is estimated and compared with those of similar atmospheric plasma sources. Our DBD reactor shows a good compromise between a good energy efficiency and the treatment of a large CO2 flow rate.",

      "abstract": "A large scale agent-based model of common Facebook users was designed to develop an understanding of the underlying mechanism of information diffusion within online social networks at a micro-level analysis. The agent-based model network structure is based on a sample from Facebook. Using an erased configuration model and the idea of common neighbours, a new correction procedure was investigated to overcome the problem of missing graph edges to construct a representative sample of the Facebook network graph. The model parameters are based on assumptions and general activity patterns (such as posting rate, time spent on Facebook etc.) taken from general data on Facebook. Using the agent-based model, the impact of post length, post score and publisher's friend count on the spread of wall posts in several scenarios was analyzed. Findings indicated that post content has the highest impact on the success of post propagation. However, amusing and absorbing but lengthy posts (e.g. a funny video) do not spread as well as short but unremarkable ones (e.g. an interesting photo). In contrast to product adoption and disease spread propagation models, the absence of a similar \"epidemic\" threshold in Facebook post diffusion is observed.",

      "abstract": "The capture and reuse of CO2 as a liquid fuel could reduce the overall anthropogenic carbon footprint but requires a catalytic pathway for CO2 hydrogenation under mild conditions, coupled with a renewable source of H2 or another reducing agent. We have computationally designed eight functional groups having both Lewis acid and base sites for inclusion inside a porous metal–organic framework (MOF) and have evaluated these functionalized MOFs for their catalytic activity toward CO2 hydrogenation. We have used density functional theory to compute reaction energies, barriers, and geometries for the elementary steps of CO2 reduction. The reaction pathways involve two elementary steps for each of the eight functional groups, consisting of heterolytic dissociation of H2 on the Lewis acid and base sites followed by concerted addition of a hydride and a proton to CO2 in a single step. Our analysis of the reaction energetics reveals that the reaction barrier for hydrogen dissociation can be correlated as a function of the chemical hardness of the Lewis acid site. Furthermore, we have identified a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship relating the barrier for the second step, CO2 hydrogenation, with the H2 adsorption energy on the Lewis sites. Surprisingly, this linear relationship also holds for correlating the hydrogenation barrier with the hydride attachment energy for the gas-phase Lewis acid site. These correlations provide a computationally efficient method for screening functional groups for their catalytic activity toward CO2 hydrogenation. These relationships are further utilized to carry out a Sabatier analysis on a simplified model of the reaction to generate contour plots of the Sabatier activity that can be used to identify properties of the functional groups for maximizing the reaction rate.",

      "abstract": "In this research, several improvements to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) were analysed. The EU ETS is a market for emission allowances and the European Union's main instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (of which CO2 is the main component). However, the CO2 allowance price in this market has been highly volatile and generally too low to stimulate significant long-term reductions in CO2 emissions. National and system-wide price floors and ceilings were investigated, prompted by the UK’s implementation of a CO2 price floor through a supplementary CO2 tax. The effects of the \"backloading\" of CO2 allowances and the proposed Market Stability Reserve were also investigated. While the latter measures may increase dynamic efficiency, this research showed that a well-designed price corridor is even more efficient, while still achieving the long-term abatement targets and stabilising prices. Furthermore, different methods for adjusting the CO2 emissions cap in response to changes in renewable energy policies were investigated. Finally, the impact of investors' risk aversion on the functioning of the CO2 market was evaluated. The analyses were conducted with the use of EMLab-Generation, an agent-based model that simulates two interconnected electricity markets with a joint CO2 emissions trading system. In this model, the companies have limited knowledge about the future, which makes it possible to investigate the impact of public policy instruments on long-term investment dynamics.",

      "abstract": "The significant benefits associated with microgrids have led to vast efforts to expand their penetration in electric power systems. Although their deployment is rapidly growing, there are still many challenges to efficiently design, control, and operate microgrids when connected to the grid, and also when in islanded mode, where extensive research activities are underway to tackle these issues. It is necessary to have an across-the-board view of the microgrid integration in power systems. This paper presents a review of issues concerning microgrids and provides an account of research in areas related to microgrids, including distributed generation, microgrid value propositions, applications of power electronics, economic issues, microgrid operation and control, microgrid clusters, and protection and communications issues.",

      "abstract": "We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co-variability of wind and solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply balancing. The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year ($-0.4 \\lesssim ρ\\lesssim -0.2$): there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter, primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months, daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately 70%-solar to 30%-wind. This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.",

      "abstract": "Activity-based models, as a specific instance of agent-based models, deal with agents that structure their activity in terms of (daily) activity schedules. An activity schedule consists of a sequence of activity instances, each with its assigned start time, duration and location, together with transport modes used for travel between subsequent activity locations. A critical step in the development of simulation models is validation. Despite the growing importance of activity-based models in modelling transport and mobility, there has been so far no work focusing specifically on statistical validation of such models. In this paper, we propose a six-step Validation Framework for Activity-based Models (VALFRAM) that allows exploiting historical real-world data to assess the validity of activity-based models. The framework compares temporal and spatial properties and the structure of activity schedules against real-world travel diaries and origin-destination matrices. We confirm the usefulness of the framework on three real-world activity-based transport models.",

      "abstract": "We are looking for the agent-based treatment of the financial markets considering necessity to build bridges between microscopic, agent based, and macroscopic, phenomenological modeling. The acknowledgment that agent-based modeling framework, which may provide qualitative and quantitative understanding of the financial markets, is very ambiguous emphasizes the exceptional value of well defined analytically tractable agent systems. Herding as one of the behavior peculiarities considered in the behavioral finance is the main property of the agent interactions we deal with in this contribution. Looking for the consentaneous agent-based and macroscopic approach we combine two origins of the noise: exogenous one, related to the information flow, and endogenous one, arising form the complex stochastic dynamics of agents. As a result we propose a three state agent-based herding model of the financial markets. From this agent-based model we derive a set of stochastic differential equations, which describes underlying macroscopic dynamics of agent population and log price in the financial markets. The obtained solution is then subjected to the exogenous noise, which shapes instantaneous return fluctuations. We test both Gaussian and q-Gaussian noise as a source of the short term fluctuations. The resulting model of the return in the financial markets with the same set of parameters reproduces empirical probability and spectral densities of absolute return observed in New York, Warsaw and NASDAQ OMX Vilnius Stock Exchanges. Our result confirms the prevalent idea in behavioral finance that herding interactions may be dominant over agent rationality and contribute towards bubble formation.",

Its goal is to simulate a phenomenon using dynamically the lightest representation to save computer resources without loss of information.

Estimates are based on extensive weather data, which allows for modelling of hourly mismatches between the demand and renewable generation from wind and solar photovoltaics. For separated countries, balancing is required to cover around 24% of the total annual energy consumption. This number can be reduced down to 15% once all countries are networked together with uncon- strained interconnectors. The reduction represents the maximum possible benefit of transmission for the countries. The total Net Transfer Capacity of the unconstrained interconnectors is roughly twelve times larger than current values. However, constrained interconnector capacities six times larger than the current values are found to provide 97% of the maximum possible benefit of cooperation. This motivates a detailed investigation of several constrained transmission capacity layouts to determine the export and import capabilities of countries participating in a fully renewable European electricity system.",

      "abstract": "Biomass use has been identified as one of the possibilities to mitigate fossil greenhouse gas emissions in iron and steelmaking. Biomass can be used to replace part of the fossil-based reducing agents in blast furnace without compromising the quality of the final product. The advantage of biomass compared to fossil-based fuels is that it is renewable energy source and can thus be considered carbon dioxide neutral within specified system boundaries. Few studies have been conducted where the effect of biomass introduction to blast furnace process have been evaluated with mathematical modeling or lab-scale experiments. The other body of literature concerns the life cycle based assessments. This study presents the effects of biomass use in plant site scale with energy balances and CO2 reduction potential. For the evaluation purposes integrated steel plant model based on physico-chemical relationships was developed. The model can be used for calculating gate-to-gate life cycle inventory for evaluating the environmental burden of the integrated steel plant. Effect of charcoal as tuyére injectant to blast furnace process was firstly evaluated. The results indicate that to replace 1 kg of specific heavy oil, 1.15 kg charcoal would be needed. Plant-wide effects of two distinct charcoal usage scenarios were evaluated and compared to base case scenario with fossil-based reducing agents. Plant site evaluation suggests that by introducing biomass to integrated steel plant, major changes in energy balances occur and significant fossil CO2 emission reduction can be achieved. This study indicates that 15.4 to 26.4% reduction in fossil CO2 emissions could be achieved in plant scale.",

      "abstract": "This white paper describes the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), whose goal is the study of dark energy and related topics in fundamental physics with data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). It provides an overview of dark energy science and describes the current and anticipated state of the field. It makes the case for the DESC by laying out a robust analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16 working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools. Members of the community are invited to join the LSST DESC, according to the membership policies described in the white paper. Applications to sign up for associate membership may be made by submitting the Web form at http://www.slac.stanford.edu/exp/lsst/desc/signup.html with a short statement of the work they wish to pursue that is relevant to the LSST DESC.",

      "abstract": "This paper summarizes the development process and main characteristics of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), a set of four new pathways developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for long-term and near-term modeling experiments. The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m^2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5x0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.",

      "abstract": "Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 is a scenario that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 W m−2 in the year 2100 without ever exceeding that value. Simulated with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), RCP4.5 includes long-term, global emissions of greenhouse gases, short-lived species, and land-use-land-cover in a global economic framework. RCP4.5 was updated from earlier GCAM scenarios to incorporate historical emissions and land cover information common to the RCP process and follows a cost-minimizing pathway to reach the target radiative forcing. The imperative to limit emissions in order to reach this target drives changes in the energy system, including shifts to electricity, to lower emissions energy technologies and to the deployment of carbon capture and geologic storage technology. In addition, the RCP4.5 emissions price also applies to land use emissions; as a result, forest lands expand from their present day extent. The simulated future emissions and land use were downscaled from the regional simulation to a grid to facilitate transfer to climate models. While there are many alternative pathways to achieve a radiative forcing level of 4.5 W m−2, the application of the RCP4.5 provides a common platform for climate models to explore the climate system response to stabilizing the anthropogenic components of radiative forcing.",

      "abstract": "Carbon dioxide clouds, which are speculated by models on solar and extra-solar planets, have been recently observed near the equator of Mars. The most comprehensive identification of Martian CO2 ice clouds has been obtained by the near-IR imaging spectrometer OMEGA. CRISM, a similar instrument with a higher spatial resolution, cannot detect these clouds with the same method due to its shorter wavelength range. Here we present a new method to detect CO2 clouds using near-IR data based on the comparison of H2O and CO2 ice spectral properties. The spatial and seasonal distributions of 54 CRISM observations containing CO2 clouds are reported, in addition to 17 new OMEGA observations. CRISM CO2 clouds are characterized by grain size in the 0.5-2\\mum range and optical depths lower than 0.3. The distributions of CO2 clouds inferred from OMEGA and CRISM are consistent with each other and match at first order the distribution of high altitude (>60km) clouds derived from previous studies. At second order, discrepancies are observed. We report the identification of H2O clouds extending up to 80 km altitude, which could explain part of these discrepancies: both CO2 and H2O clouds can exist at high, mesospheric altitudes. CRISM observations of afternoon CO2 clouds display morphologies resembling terrestrial cirrus, which generalizes a previous result to the whole equatorial clouds season. Finally, we show that morning OMEGA observations have been previously misinterpreted as evidence for cumuliform, and hence potentially convective, CO2 clouds.",

      "abstract": "A review was conducted on the use of thermochemical biomass gasification for producing biofuels, biopower and chemicals. The upstream processes for gasification are similar to other biomass processing methods. However, challenges remain in the gasification and downstream processing for viable commercial applications. The challenges with gasification are to understand the effects of operating conditions on gasification reactions for reliably predicting and optimizing the product compositions, and for obtaining maximal efficiencies. Product gases can be converted to biofuels and chemicals such as Fischer-Tropsch fuels, green gasoline, hydrogen, dimethyl ether, ethanol, methanol, and higher alcohols. Processes and challenges for these conversions are also summarized.",

Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is ~6 deg-C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, large scale glaciation occurring when CO2 fell to 450 +/- 100 ppm, a level that will be exceeded within decades, barring prompt policy changes. If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.",

The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.",

      "doi": null,
      "abstract": "The aim of this research in progress is to examine the effect of CO2-emission trading and the intensified application of renewable energy sources to the liberalized power market. The research approach applies methods from a combination of economics, natural sciences and computer science in order to obtain decision support for the planning of future power plant structures, investment decisions, and emission scales. Besides the liberalization, future power markets are increasingly influenced by regulatory acts which are mainly responding to the necessity of a structured reduction of CO2-emissions. For CO2-eminssions, which are generated by the production of electric power, an emission trading system with obligatory participation is being launched from 2005 on. Since in the same period, the amount of power which has to be produced from renewable energy sources is increased dramatically, an additional incoming aspect is the fluctuating character of many of those sources. These changed general conditions in the industrial power sector cause novel structures at international power markets and additionally a new emissions situation. The aim of this research is the conception of a methodologically innovative concept to simulate power markets based on multi-agent systems (MAS) and agent-based computational economics (ACE) which fulfils the described desiderata. Since heterogeneous utility functions for individual market participants can be modelled - in comparison to existing centrally steered simulation methods - a multi-agent based simulation approach promises more realistic simulation results. Specific behaviour and the dynamic adoption of the strategies of individual participants based on the experiences derived from market behaviour can explicitly be simulated. The aim of the research approach is to obtain a strengthened understanding of the mutual effects among heterogeneous participants and the dynamics of the market of CO2-emissions as well as renewable energy resources. To disseminate these results, acting recommendations for participants at international power markets as well as political and regulatory authorities are derived.",

Accurate knowledge of these energies is of primary importance to set the absolute energy scale for the measurement of the W boson mass. The beam energy between 80 and 104 GeV is derived from continuous measurements of the magnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP dipoles. The relationship between the fields measured by the probes and the beam energy is defined in the NMR model, which is calibrated against precise measurements of the average beam energy between 41 and 61 GeV made using the resonant depolarisation technique. The validity of the NMR model is verified by three independent methods: the flux-loop, which is sensitive to the bending field of all the dipoles of LEP; the spectrometer, which determines the energy through measurements of the deflection of the beam in a magnet of known integrated field; and an analysis of the variation of the synchrotron tune with the total RF voltage. To obtain the centre-of-mass energies, corrections are then applied to account for sources of bending field external to the dipoles, and variations in the local beam energy at each interaction point. The relative error on the centre-of-mass energy determination for the majority of LEP 2 running is 1.2 x 10^{-4}, which is sufficiently precise so as not to introduce a dominant uncertainty on the W mass measurement.",

Pessimistic critics of empirically estimated curves have argued that their declining portions are illusory, either because they are cross-sectional snapshots that mask a long-run “race to the bottom” in environmental standards, or because industrial societies will continually produce new pollutants as the old ones are controlled. However, recent evidence has fostered an optimistic view by suggesting that the curve is actually flattening and shifting to the left. The driving forces appear to be economic liberalization, clean technology diffusion, and new approaches to pollution regulation in developing countries.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to solving N-queen problems, which involves a model of distributed autonomous agents with artificial life (ALife) and a method of representing N-queen constraints in an agent environment. The distributed agents locally interact with their living environment, i.e., a chessboard, and execute their reactive behaviors by applying their behavioral rules for randomized motion, least-conflict position searching, and cooperating with other agents etc. The agent-based N-queen problem solving system evolves through selection and contest according to the rule of Survival of the Fittest, in which some agents will die or be eaten if their moving strategies are less efficient than others. The experimental results have shown that this system is capable of solving large-scale N-queen problems. This paper also provides a model of ALife agents for solving general CSPs.",

The beam energy above 80 GeV is derived from continuous measurements of the magnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP dipoles. The relationship between the fields measured by the probes and the beam energy is calibrated against precise measurements of the average beam energy between 41 and 55 GeV made using the resonant depolarisation technique. The linearity of the relationship is tested by comparing the fields measured by the probes with the total bending field measured by a flux loop. This test results in the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty. Several further corrections are applied to derive the the centre-of-mass energies at each interaction point. In addition the centre-of-mass energy spread is evaluated. The beam energy has been determined with a precision of 25 MeV for the data taken in 1997, corresponding to a relative precision of 2.7x10^{-4}. This is small in comparison to the present uncertainty on the W mass measurement at LEP. However, the ultimate statistical precision on the W mass with the full LEP2 data sample should be around 25 MeV, and a smaller uncertainty on the beam energy is desirable.
