**Keywords:** physics.ao-ph

**Abstract:**

> We use reanalysis data to investigate the daily co-variability of wind and solar irradiance in Britain, and its implications for renewable energy supply balancing. The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year ($-0.4 \lesssim ρ\lesssim -0.2$): there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier. ...

Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is ~6 deg-C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, large scale glaciation occurring when CO2 fell to 450 +/- 100 ppm, a level that will be exceeded within decades, barr...

**Source:** arXiv
**Keywords:** hep-ex, physics.acc-ph

**Abstract:**

> The determination of the centre-of-mass energies for all LEP 2 running is presented. Accurate knowledge of these energies is of primary importance to set the absolute energy scale for the measurement of the W boson mass. The beam energy between 80 and 104 GeV is derived from continuous measurements of the magnetic bending field by 16 NMR probes situated in a number of the LEP dipoles. The relationship between the fields measured by the probes and the beam energy is defined in the NMR model, whic...

**Source:** OpenAlex
**Keywords:** Kuznets curve, Economics, Phillips curve, Race to the bottom, Development economics, Macroeconomics

**Abstract:**

> The environmental Kuznets curve posits an inverted-U relationship between pollution and economic development. Pessimistic critics of empirically estimated curves have argued that their declining portions are illusory, either because they are cross-sectional snapshots that mask a long-run “race to the bottom” in environmental standards, or because industrial societies will continually produce new pollutants as the old ones are controlled. However, recent evidence has fostered an optimistic view b...

**Source:** arXiv
**Keywords:** cs.AI, cs.DS, cs.MA

**Abstract:**

> This paper presents a new approach to solving N-queen problems, which involves a model of distributed autonomous agents with artificial life (ALife) and a method of representing N-queen constraints in an agent environment. The distributed agents locally interact with their living environment, i.e., a chessboard, and execute their reactive behaviors by applying their behavioral rules for randomized motion, least-conflict position searching, and cooperating with other agents etc. The agent-based N...

**URL:** [https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.4.83](https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.4.83)
**Source:** OpenAlex
**Keywords:** Federalism, Decentralization, Incentive, Fiscal federalism, Salient, Corporate governance, Economics, Cooperative federalism, State (computer science), Competition (biology)

**Abstract:**

> The authors advance a new perspective in the study of federalism. Their approach views federalism as a governance solution of the state to credibly preserving market incentives. Market incentives are preserved if the state is credibly prevented from compromising on future economic success and from bailing out future failures. The salient features of federalism--decentralization of information and authority and interjurisdictional competition--help provide credible commitment or these purposes. I...

**Abstract:**

> This paper makes the case that purposive, profit-seeking investments in knowledge play a critical role in the long-run growth process. First, the authors review the implications of neoclassical growth theory and the more recent theories of ‘endogenous growth.’ Then they discuss the empirical evidence that bears on the modeling of long-run growth. Finally, the authors describe in more detail a model of growth based on endogenous technological progress and discuss the lessons that such models can ...
