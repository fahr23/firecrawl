      "abstract": "Addressing the contemporary climate crisis is the need of the hour to protect both people and the planet. As countries embark on green energy revolution, focussing on achieving the United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, guaranteeing universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services stands out as an important goal. As part of the implementation of this goal, solar panel installation scheme has been undertaken by the government of India to encourage widespread adoption of green energy. This research work proposes an effective method to assess the acceptance of this scheme among users and the broader audience. User comments/ feedback from various social networking sites are analysed in this research work using Machine Learning techniques along with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to make the machine learning models’ predictions more transparent. OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model is also used to automatically identify key implementation challenges of the scheme by creating a concise summary of the feedback shared by the users. This insight, based on the pain points of the users, can further help in providing recommendations and suggestions to appropriate stakeholders to improve the success rate of this scheme. Five machine learning models- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Stochastic Gradient Descent- were compared to choose the right technique for sentiment analysis. Among them, Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting the sentiment. Our analysis showed around 63% of user feedback was positive indicating the public acceptance of green energy projects in India despite higher initial investments. The methodology and framework developed during this research work have immense reusability across similar government schemes (where transparency in sentiment analysis and sensitivity of public data are critical) in assessing their effectiveness and identifying areas where improvements are required.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               Renewable energy (RE) plays a critical role in mitigating climate change and ensuring energy security globally. As the adoption of RE technologies continues to grow, accurate forecasting of renewable energy consumption has become increasingly important for grid planning and integration. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the key factors influencing renewable energy consumption and the application of machine learning and deep learning models for forecasting RE consumption. The study examines various socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental variables that have been found to impact the demand and usage of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower. Factors like GDP, population, energy prices, government policies, and weather conditions are discussed in detail for their influence on RE consumption patterns. The paper also analyzes how technological advancements, consumer behavior, and energy efficiency measures can shape renewable energy demand. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the performance of various machine learning techniques, which have been done in various research from 2020 to 2024, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning models such as long short-term memory (LSTMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in forecasting renewable energy consumption. The study analyzes the strengths, limitations, and accuracy of these models based on case studies across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The findings indicate that deep learning models, particularly LSTMs and CNNs, have outperformed traditional machine learning techniques in renewable energy consumption forecasting. These deep learning models are able to capture the complex nonlinear relationships and temporal dependencies inherent in RE consumption data, leading to higher accuracy and better generalization performance.",

      "abstract": "Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are being more integrated into the power grid due to the growing demand for environmentally friendly energy. To optimize energy utilization and guarantee grid stability, innovative energy storage management systems are required due to the intermittent nature of various energy sources. In this study, we use machine learning (ML) to investigate new ways of managing energy storage in renewable power systems that include solar and wind power. Utilizing ML algorithms for energy demand forecasting, solar and wind power generation prediction, and ESS charging and discharging cycle optimization is the main emphasis of the work. Machine learning models can better predict grid demand and the amount of renewable energy that will be available, allowing for more effective energy storage and usage, which in turn reduces waste and increases system resilience. Optimization of storage capacity, real-time balance of supply and demand, and minimization of energy loss are some of the major issues in renewable energy management that can be tackled by combining energy storage systems with ML-based predictive models. To maximize energy storage operation in dynamic situations, this research studies several ML techniques, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and time-series forecasting. Hybrid storage options, which combine batteries with supercapacitors or other sophisticated storage technologies, are also investigated in the study as a possible means to improve performance. In addition, the article delves into the topic of smart grids and monitoring systems that are based on the internet of things (IoT). These systems allow for the collection and analysis of data in real-time, which in turn makes energy management systems more responsive. Insights into how machine learning can revolutionize energy storage management are provided by this research. This, in turn, promotes the effective grid integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind and helps usher in a more sustainable energy future.",

      "abstract": "As a result of the need to satisfy energy needs and cut carbon emissions, all nations across the world have agreed to work together to use renewable energy in different parts of the energy ecosystem. Research trends indicate that artificial intelligence methodologies are attracting scholarly interest and can facilitate effective system optimization in the absence of extensive long-term meteorological data. The main goal of this review is to examine the various machine learning approaches used in nanofluid-based renewable energy systems and to highlight recent breakthroughs in machine learning research. Several recent machine learning methods being used in renewable energy systems were reviewed. It was observed that ANN, ANFIS, and SVM are the most commonly used methods for modeling and predicting solar, wind, and biomass energy systems. It is suggested that the prognostic performance of ML approaches can be improved through hyperparameter tuning and optimization. Alongside more common neural networks and fuzzy- and gene-based machine learning methods, newer ensemble methods such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN), Boosted regression, K-means, AdaBoost, and XGBoost are becoming more popular because they offer improved architectures and can handle a broader range of data types. The neural networks and fuzzy-based algorithms that people use most of the time are primarily black-box approaches, which means that the user doesn't know how they operate. This is why the explainable methods are needed.",

      "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources into modern power grids introduces significant challenges to maintaining grid stability due to the inherent variability and unpredictability of these energy sources. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict and enhance smart grid stability, focusing on scenarios involving renewable energy integration. Using the Electrical Grid Stability Simulated Dataset, we develop and evaluate predictive models that classify grid states as stable or unstable, analyze the impact of renewable energy inputs, and identify key factors influencing stability. red The proposed ML framework achieves a classification accuracy of 94% using Neural Networks, outperforming traditional models such as Random Forest (92%) and Logistic Regression (88%). Sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing frame size from 40 to 320 reduces BER from 0.04 to 0.005, while excessive iterations beyond 5 show diminishing returns. Our method enables real-time monitoring with a 50% reduction in false alarms, enhancing grid stability . Additionally, we highlight the role of interleaved randomness, feature selection, and data-driven approaches in achieving robust predictions. This research underscores the potential of machine learning to transform grid management, offering practical solutions for energy load optimization and real-time stability monitoring. Our findings contribute to the development of smarter, more resilient power systems capable of integrating renewable energy sources seamlessly",

      "abstract": "Accurate solar radiation prediction is pivotal for optimizing solar energy systems, as it allows for better energy storage, grid integration, and renewable energy planning. This study compares the predictive accuracy of three machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)- in forecasting solar radiation based on a meteorological and temporal features dataset. The dataset, encompassing Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times, was preprocessed through transformations (Box-Cox, logarithmic scaling) and feature selection methods (SelectKBest, Extra Trees Classifier) to enhance model performance. XGBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving an R² of 0.93 and RMSE of 81.87, effectively capturing complex nonlinear relationships within the data. MLP, while slightly lower in R², yielded the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 41.74), underscoring its precision in individual predictions. SelectKBest identified set Hour (sunset hour), Month, and Wind Direction as critical features, while Extra Trees prioritized Wind Direction, Minute, and Humidity, reflecting model-specific feature importance. Collectively, these models illustrate the benefits of integrating feature engineering with advanced machine learning for renewable energy optimization, with XGBoost and MLP demonstrating particular efficacy for accurate solar radiation forecasting. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing solar energy management, facilitating a more efficient transition to sustainable energy sources.",

LASSO regression, random forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost 2.1.3), LightGBM, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were all selected due to their ability to effectively handle large datasets. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the utility of the Energy Uncertainty Index (EUI) within commonly accepted models to ensure replicability and relevance to a broad audience. The integration of the EUI as an independent variable is a critical innovation of this research, as it addresses the challenges presented by fluctuations in energy markets. A more nuanced comprehension of consumption trends in the presence of uncertainty is achieved through this inclusion. We evaluate the performance of these models in the context of renewable energy consumption forecasting, identifying their strengths and limitations. The results indicate that the prognostic potential of the models is considerably improved by the inclusion of the EUI, providing valuable insights for energy policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders. These advancements emphasize the role of machine learning in achieving efficient resource allocation, guiding infrastructure development, minimizing risks, and supporting the global transition toward renewable energy and sustainability.",

Traditional control strategies, such as pulse-width modulation (PWM), maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and basic voltage and current controls, are foundational yet often fall short in adapting to the rapid fluctuation’s characteristic of renewable energy supply. The ML-DC2A optimizes crucial performance indicators including conversion efficiency, reliability, adaptability to energy supply variability, and response time to changing loads. By leveraging predictive analytics and adaptive algorithms, it dynamically manages the conversion process, offering superior performance over traditional techniques. A notable drawback of conventional methods is their inability to anticipate and adjust to real-time changes in energy availability and demand, leading to inefficiencies and potential system instability. The proposed ML-DC2A addresses these challenges by incorporating a sophisticated ML framework that predicts future energy scenarios and adaptively adjusts system parameters to maintain optimal performance. Initial results highlight the transformative potential of integrating ML into renewable energy conversion systems, promising significantly enhanced efficiency and system resilience, thus marking a significant step forward in sustainable energy management.&lt;/span&gt;",

      "abstract": "Providing electricity needs from renewable energy sources is an important issue in the energy policies of countries. Especially changes in energy usage rates make it necessary to use renewable energy resources to be sustainable. The electricity usage rate must be estimated accurately to make reliable decisions in strategic planning and future investments in renewable energy. This study aims to accurately estimate the renewable energy production rate to meet Türkiye’s electricity needs from renewable energy sources. For this purpose, well-known Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AB), and Gradient Boosting (GB) were utilized. In obtaining forecast data, 15 variables were considered under the oil resources, environmental parameters, and economic factors which are the main parameters affecting renewable energy usage rates. The RF algorithm performed best with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, 0.084%), mean absolute error (MAE, 0.035), root mean square error (RMSE, 0.063), and mean squared error (MSE, 0.004) values in the test dataset. The R2 value of this model is 0.996% and the MAPE value is calculated lower than 10%. The AB model, on the other hand, has the highest error values in the test data set, but still provides an acceptable prediction accuracy. The R2 value was 0.792% and the MAPE value (0.371%) of this model was calculated to be in the range of 20% &lt; MAPE≤50%. This study, with its proposed forecasting models, makes significant contributions to energy policies to develop appropriate policies only for planning the amount of electricity usage needed in the future. In this context, this study emphasizes that renewable energy-based electricity generation transformation should be considered as an important strategic goal in terms of both environmental sustainability and energy security.",

      "abstract": "The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing reliance on renewable energy sources underscore the urgent need for accurate forecasting of EV charging demand to support the development of sustainable and resilient energy systems. This study proposes an explainable machine learning (ML)-based approach to predict hourly EV charging demand using a high-resolution dataset from California, spanning January 2021 to May 2024. Five ML models—XGBoost, random forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and linear regression—were evaluated, with XGBoost achieving the highest predictive accuracy. Scenario analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between renewable energy penetration and EV charging demand: 10%, 20%, and 30% increases in renewable usage led to 20%, 33%, and 47% increases in predicted demand, respectively. SHAP-based feature importance analysis identified renewable energy usage, carbon footprint reduction, and grid stability as key drivers of charging behavior. The proposed framework offers a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven solution to support the alignment of EV charging infrastructure with decarbonization goals. By linking renewable energy integration with demand-side dynamics, the findings offer actionable insights for the design of adaptive electricity pricing strategies and sustainable mobility policies, contributing to the broader vision of low-carbon, environmentally responsible transportation systems.",

      "abstract": "Renewable energy efficiency (REE) remains critically low across many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, yet the existing literature provides limited empirical clarity on how governance quality shapes efficiency outcomes and through which mechanisms these effects operate. This study addresses this gap by examining the influence of governance quality on REE in 23 SSA countries from 2005 to 2023, drawing on institutional theory and innovation diffusion theory. The analysis investigates three mediating channels, renewable investment, green policy, and green technology, using a multidimensional empirical framework that integrates the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI), Two-Step System GMM, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), Generalized Least Squares (GLS), and Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE). Results consistently show that governance quality significantly enhances REE through investment, policy, and technological pathways. To capture nonlinearities and heterogeneous responses often overlooked in traditional models, we complement the econometric estimations with causal machine-learning simulations (Double Machine Learning and Causal Forests). These counterfactual analyses reveal that governance improvements and renewable-policy adoption produce the highest efficiency gains in mid-governance countries with stronger absorptive capacity. While the study offers policy-relevant insights, limitations remain, due to data constraints, unobserved institutional dynamics, and the uneven maturity of green-technology systems across the region. Nevertheless, the findings underscore that strengthening governance and fostering innovation are fundamental to accelerating a sustainable and inclusive green-energy transition in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

This research develops and rigorously evaluates a range of deep learning models—such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) architectures—for predicting solar, wind, and total renewable energy production at a national scale. These models are systematically benchmarked against traditional machine learning approaches and gradient boosting methods to determine their predictive capabilities. The findings demonstrate that deep learning models incorporating memory mechanisms consistently surpass conventional methods, with BiLSTM standing out as the most precise and dependable model. Furthermore, the study investigates fully connected artificial neural networks (ANNs) and ConvLSTM2D models, reinforcing the advantages of memory-based architectures in modeling temporal relationships. By introducing a robust deep learning framework for large-scale renewable energy forecasting, this research represents a considerable leap forward compared to traditional machine learning techniques.

      "abstract": "The transition to renewable energy is essential for mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Despite its vast potential, the region faces structural and economic challenges that hinder a sustainable energy transition. Understanding scientific production in this field is key to shaping policy, investment, and technological progress. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a large-scale, data-driven analysis of renewable energy research in LAC, mapping its thematic evolution, collaboration networks, and key research trends over the past three decades. To achieve this, machine learning-based topic modeling and network analysis were applied to examine research trends in renewable energy in LAC. A dataset of 18,780 publications (1994–2024) from Scopus and Web of Science was analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover thematic structures. Network analysis assessed collaboration patterns and regional integration in research. Findings indicate a growing focus on solar, wind, and bioenergy advancements, alongside increasing attention to climate change policies, energy storage, and microgrid optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in energy management are emerging, mirroring global trends. However, research disparities persist, with Brazil, Mexico, and Chile leading output while smaller nations remain underrepresented. International collaborations, especially with North America and Europe, play a crucial role in research development. Renewable energy research supports Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action). Despite progress, challenges remain in translating research into policy and addressing governance, financing, and socio-environmental factors. AI-driven analytics offer opportunities for improved energy planning. Strengthening regional collaboration, increasing research investment, and integrating AI into policy frameworks will be crucial for advancing the energy transition in LAC. This study provides evidence-based insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders.",

Accurate forecasting of renewable generation is crucial for mitigating these challenges.

The proposed method is evaluated against various forecasting methods using key metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared value. Results show that the 1-D CNN model achieves an improvement of up to 229.8 times in MSE and a 24.47 fold improvement in MAE compared to baseline models that use traditional statistical methods in forecasting. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning for enhancing microgrid management, particularly in short-term forecasting of renewable generation.",

Reliable load pattern forecasting for renewable energy sources and efficient energy storage use are essential for efficient power grid management. For renewable energy data, the intricacies that conventional forecasting techniques, such as autoregressive or statistical approaches, miss include nonlinearities, complicated dynamics, and strong temporal correlations. Forecasting the production of renewable energy sources accurately is therefore vital for optimizing energy storage use and maintaining system stability. This study proposes a CNN-LSTM architecture-integrated deep learning-based forecasting framework to enhance comprehension of the spatial feature representations and temporal correlations in energy and weather historical data. Using real-world wind and solar datasets, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieved a prediction accuracy that was 15-22% higher than that of baseline statistical and machine learning approaches such as Random Forest and ARIMA. Innovative dual-stage design combines optimum training approach for non-stationary renewable data with temporal-spatial feature learning to boost flexibility for grid-level deployment.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               As the oil and gas industry strives to meet its energy transition goals while ensuring reliable and uninterruptable electricity generation to meet its operational needs, where grid access is often limited, Renewable Energy Sources (RES), particularly wind and solar power, have become increasingly vital. Stationary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a pivotal role in the electricity needs at oil and gas sites, providing backup power for critical systems, enabling microgrid stability, and reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-powered generators. This paper addresses the challenge of the limited useful life of LIBs—a key energy storage solution for integrating renewable energy sources for the oil and gas industry applications—by leveraging advanced AI and machine learning techniques. A Machine Learning predictive model is developed using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to enhance the accuracy and reliability of battery management systems. The model is trained on an extensive dataset of grid-scale LIBs which includes measurements of Voltage, Current, Cell Temperature, and Environment Temperature. Rigorous data pre-processing steps were undertaken to ensure data integrity and enhance model performance. A sequential time-based splitting technique preserved the temporal dependencies crucial for time-series analysis. Feature engineering identified Voltage and Current as critical predictors, supplemented by timestamps and temperature features. Data augmentation was employed to generate synthetic time series measurements of capacity, further enhancing accuracy, model stability, and generalization. The LSTM model effectively predicts the annual degradation in the charging capacity of grid-scale stationary Lithium-ion batteries subjected to the sporadic currents generated by RES, achieving a Root Mean Square Error of 0.0126 and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0107, proving its adequacy for handling the complex, non-linear dynamics of time-series data inherent in battery performance metrics. This study addresses a significant gap in research, focusing on predicting the charging capacity of LIBs in offshore and remote locations where the batteries experience sporadic current, as opposed to the constant current and voltage conditions typically studied. It underscores the potential for machine learning-driven advancements in energy storage technology, for enhanced efficiency and consequently more sustainable oil and gas operations.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new energy management framework for the optimum scheduling of distributed generation resources within a smart distribution system that contains multiple interconnected microgrids under normal and abnormal operating conditions. First, a systematic management framework is established by defining the functions of various management units throughout the multi-microgrid system. In the suggested two-step approach, each microgrid schedules its own resources based on the developed model, while in the second step, the distribution system operator makes a decision on power transfers among microgrids and allocates the remaining unserved loads from the first step. Due to the inherent variability of renewable resources, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model is applied in order to forecast solar irradiation and wind power. The significant contributions of the work include (1) a new approach to uncertainty modeling of renewable energy sources and consumer loads, using ELM for probabilistic modeling of the fluctuations of renewables and demand; (2) coalition strategy formation in local and global energy trading for microgrids with an objective of cost minimization and profitability improvement; and (3) incorporation of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems for better electric vehicle charging management and contribution to system stability due to renewable energy uncertainties. Besides, the proposed framework has been applied and validated on a test system for practical scenarios. The approach demonstrates considerable enhancements in efficiency, resilience, and cost-effectiveness upon multi-microgrid networks under various operating conditions.",

This study proposes a robust classification framework using a publicly available renewable energy dataset comprising multivariate time-series data from solar, wind, and hydro sources. Standard preprocessing techniques, including normalization and segmentation, were applied to prepare the data for modeling. We evaluate several machine learning and deep learning models Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN). To further enhance performance, we introduce a hybrid 1D-CNN model integrated with an attention mechanism to improve feature extraction and model focus on relevant temporal patterns. Experimental results show that the attention-enhanced hybrid model achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 97.8%, precision of 97.5%, recall of 97.7%, and F1-score of 97.6%, outperforming all baseline models. Compared to the best traditional model (XGBoost, 93.2% accuracy), our approach shows a 4.6% improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning for renewable energy classification and lays a foundation for future intelligent and sustainable energy management systems.",

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with renewable energy technologies is transforming sustainable power generation by improving control, efficiency, and adaptive decision-making. Traditional solar tracking and wind turbine systems, however, rely on static control algorithms that struggle to adapt to real-time environmental changes like cloud cover, shading, variable sunlight, and fluctuating wind patterns, leading to inefficiencies in energy harvesting. This study aims to design AI-enhanced control mechanisms for solar and wind systems to optimize energy yield and minimize maintenance costs. The methodology integrates machine learning (ML), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and computer vision into solar and wind equipment control systems. For solar systems, real-time data from IoT sensors dynamically adjusts panel orientation, and predictive analytics forecast solar irradiation trends for proactive positioning. Whereas fuzzy logic controllers adjust performance reinforcement learning optimizes blade pitch and yaw in wind turbines according to wind conditions. A comparative analysis reveals that AI-driven systems have lower operating costs and a 25% increase in energy output. The results show how AI-powered wind turbine and solar tracking systems can adapt to changes in the environment increasing dependability and energy efficiency. This study establishes the groundwork for future developments in edge computing blockchain and hybrid AI models for decentralized energy distribution.",

      "abstract": "The pursuit of carbon neutrality is reshaping global energy systems, making the transition to renewable energy critical for mitigating climate change. However, unstable weather conditions continue to challenge energy consumption stability and grid reliability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) models at predicting energy consumption differences and employs the SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) interpretability tool to quantify the influence of key weather variables, using five years of data (2017–2022) and 196,776 observations collected across Europe. The dataset consists of hourly weather and energy consumption records, and key variables such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), sunlight duration, day length, cloud cover, and humidity are identified as critical predictors. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) model achieves the highest accuracy and stability (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 360.17, MAE = 208.84), outperforming other models in predicting energy consumption differences. Through SHAP analysis, this study demonstrates the profound influence of GHI, which exhibits a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with energy consumption variance. Incorporating advanced data preprocessing and predictor selection techniques remains the RMSE of RF but reduces the RMSE by approximately 25% for the XGBoost model, underlining the importance of selecting appropriate input variables. Hyperparameter tuning further enhances model performance, particularly for less robust algorithms prone to overfitting. The study reveals the complex seasonal and regional effects of weather conditions on energy demands. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ML models at addressing the challenges of complex energy systems and provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners to optimize energy management strategies, integrate renewable energy sources, and achieve sustainable development objectives.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n\t  Accurate prediction of nondispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presented a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at a country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites’ capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from Réseau de Transport d’Electricité (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ECMWF Re-Analysis v5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in normalized root-mean-squared error for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.",

Meanwhile, rural households rely mainly on agriculture as a major source of income. The relationship between energy demand and agricultural production can help us identify effective rural electrification methods. This study analyses whether improved productivity in agriculture contributes to decentralised renewable energy use in Ghana, utilising double machine learning (ML) methods to address concerns surrounding endogeneity. The study applied random forest techniques, accompanied by cross‐validation approaches, to estimate data from 21,583 area samples to identify market access, infrastructure improvement and wealth as probable causal channels in the market. The findings revealed that an increase in productivity by one unit increases energy demand by 1.127 kWh when market access becomes a leading channel. Significant relationships are observed among variables like distance to market centres, road network and grid accessibility, whereas correlations surrounding wealth and infrastructure show mixed results. Channel‐based relationships show robust strength using different ML procedures, including different cross‐validation setups. The study recommends targeted rural energy investments proportionate to levels of productivity in agriculture, the implementation of integrated infrastructure programmes to raise market accessibility and the restructuring of funding mechanisms within the entire marketing cycle of agriculture, rather than relying on household accumulation of wealth. These recommendations emphasise coordinated rural development initiatives aiming to push forward productivity in agriculture alongside increased access to renewable energy sources.",

      "abstract": "Wind speed prediction plays a crucial role in renewable energy planning and optimization. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of wind speed forecasting using Random Forest (RF) models. The research utilized high-resolution wind speed data collected throughout 2023 at the Bowen Abbot facility. Our methodology employed a RF with cross-validation techniques to ensure model stability and reliability. The model demonstrated robust performance across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving an average R² score of 0.9155 (±0.0035) through 5-fold cross-validation. Error analysis revealed consistent performance across training, testing, and validation sets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.6624 (±0.0098) m/s. Feature importance analysis revealed that the 3-hour rolling mean wind speed was the most influential predictor, accounting for 89.84% of the model's predictive power, followed by 1-hour (2.59%) and 3-hour (2.57%) lagged wind speeds. This hierarchical importance of temporal features suggests that recent wind patterns are crucial for accurate predictions. The error distribution analysis showed approximately normal distributions with slight deviations in the tails, particularly in the validation set (kurtosis: 5.2146). Key findings indicate that the model maintains high prediction accuracy across different temporal scales, with mean absolute errors (MAE) averaging 0.4998 (±0.0098) m/s. The model's stability across different data partitions suggests its reliability for operational deployment. These results demonstrate the potential of RF algorithms for accurate wind speed forecasting in renewable energy applications, providing a valuable tool for wind power generation planning and management. The study's findings contribute to the growing body of research on machine learning applications in renewable energy, offering insights into model performance evaluation and error analysis methodologies for wind speed prediction systems.",

To improve solar power management's dependability, this research proposes a short-term solar forecasting framework powered by AI. Multiple machine learning models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), AdaBoost, neural networks (NN), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), and linear regression (LR), are integrated into the suggested system, which also uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The Abiod Sid Cheikh station in Algeria (2019-2021) provided real-world data for the model's validation. With a two-hour-ahead RMSE of 0.557 kW/m², AdaBoost had the most accuracy, whereas LR had the lowest, at 0.510 kW/m². In addition to increasing computing efficiency, PCA preserved 99.3% of the data volatility. In addition to increasing computing efficiency, PCA preserved 99.3% of the data volatility.

      "abstract": "Based on the renewable energy assessment in 2023, it was found that only 21% of total electricity is generated using renewable sources. As the global demand for electricity rises in the AI world, the need for electricity management will increase and must be optimized. Based on research, many companies are working on green AI electricity management, but few companies are working on predicting shortages. To identify the rising electricity demand, predict the shortage, and to bring attention to consumption, this study focuses on the optimization of solar electricity generation, tracking its consumption, and forecasting the electricity shortages well in advance. This system demonstrates a novel approach using advanced machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning to maximize solar energy utilization. This paper proposes and develops a community-based model that manages and analyzes multiple buildings’ energy usage, allowing the model to perform both distributed and aggregated decision-making, achieving an accuracy of 98.2% using stacking results of models with reinforcement learning.

Using machine learning, it is now much simpler to forecast the amount of solar energy that will be generated. These approaches are more accurate and are able to adapt to the ever changing conditions of the nature of the environment. We take a look at the most recent machine learning algorithms for predicting solar energy and examine their methodology, as well as their strengths and drawbacks, in this paper. Using performance metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) makes it possible to evaluate important algorithms like support vector machines, decision trees, and linear regression. The results show that machine learning could help make predictions more accurate, lower the amount of uncertainty in operations, and help people make decisions in real time for PV systems. The study also points out important areas where research is lacking and suggests ways to move forward with the use of machine learning in systems that produce renewable energy.",

In this regard, it becomes quite necessary to accurately forecast the models so that one can optimize energy generation and guarantee grid stability. This work studies the application of several machine learning algorithms, including Cat Boost, AdaBoost, and Light GBM, to solar energy generation forecasting. The approach has been applied based on data from two solar stations over a period of two years, where the performance of each stand-alone algorithm and a hybrid model that will be optimized with War SO optimizer is analyzed and presented. The standalone CatBoost model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an R² of 0.9106 and RMSE of 4.06 MW in the 30 MW farm. Hybrid models further improved accuracy, with the AdaBoost-War SO model reaching an R² of 0.9836 and RMSE of 1.75 MW. These results confirm the efficiency of utilizing machine learning approaches toward enhancing accuracy in renewable energy forecasting, and therefore hybrid models play an important role in energy prediction with higher accuracy",

      "abstract": "An accurate estimation of wind energy productivity is crucial for the success of energy transition strategies in developing countries such as Pakistan, for which the deployment of renewables is essential. This study investigates the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve wind farm producibility assessments, tailored to the Pakistani context. SCADA data from a wind turbine in Türkiye were used to train and validate five predictive models. Among these, Random Forest proved most reliable, attaining a coefficient of determination of 0.97 on the testing dataset. The trained model was then employed to simulate the annual production of a 5 × 5 wind farm at two representative sites in Pakistan—one onshore and one offshore—that had been selected using ERA5 reanalysis data. In comparison with conventional estimates based on the theoretical power curve, the machine learning-based approach resulted in net energy predictions up to 20% lower. This is attributable to real-world effects such as wake and grid losses. The onshore site yielded an LCOE of 0.059 USD/kWh, closely aligning with the IRENA’s 2024 national average of approximately 0.06 USD/kWh, thereby confirming the reliability of the estimates. In contrast, the offshore site exhibited an LCOE of 0.120 USD/kWh, thus underscoring the need for incentives to support offshore development in Pakistan’s renewable energy strategy.",

      "abstract": "The search for renewable energy sources has driven the desire for knowledge about the energy source of photovoltaic systems and the factors that can influence it. This study applies powerful machine learning techniques to identify the best model for predicting photovoltaic energy generation, using meteorological variables as key inputs. The energy generated data were collected in a photovoltaic plant installed in the city of Pontes e Lacerda, while the meteorological variables were collected from nearby INMET stations. Four different techniques were employed, including SVR (Support Vector Machine), Random Forest, LSTM Neural Network and SARIMAX. The results showed that the Random Forest technique presented the best performance, with calculated values for the coefficient of determination (R2) and Willmott index of 0.909 and 0.972, respectively, standing out for accuracy and efficiency in scenarios where data is available. On the other hand, it was revealed that the model generated by the SARIMAX technique had great potential for applications where there is little data availability, presenting satisfactory estimates. This study highlights the practical applications of machine learning in optimizing photovoltaic power generation plant design and management, including improving energy prediction accuracy, enabling better decision-making, and supporting the expansion of renewable energy sources, especially in areas with scarce data. The findings also reinforce the critical role of meteorological variables in influencing the performance of photovoltaic systems, offering valuable insights for future applications in energy systems planning and operation.",

      "abstract": "The prediction of wind energy generation is important to enhance the performance and dependability of renewable energy systems due to the rising demand for wind-generated electricity and advancements in wind energy technology competitiveness. This study leverages advanced machine learning (ML) and some other statistical and deep learning based time series forecasting models to enhance the accuracy of wind energy predictions. This comprehensive analysis includes nine ML models—Linear Regression, Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Neural Networks—as well as Four time-series forecasting models—ARIMA, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and GRU. Each ML model underwent rigorous cross-validation to ensure optimal performance. The assessment criteria utilized here comprised the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the R² Score. It was found that among the nine ML models, Random Forests, GBM and KNN consistently provided superior accuracy and robustness, making them the top choices for wind energy prediction whereas the performance of linear regression, SVM and SVR were very poor for the considered dataset. From the experiment, Random Forest, GBM, and KNN showed the best performance with low MSE values of 0.77, 1.95, and 1.51 respectively, while other models had MSEs above 7.5, with AdaBoost reaching 30. Their RMSEs (0.88, 1.40, 1.23) and MAEs (0.093, 0.73, 0.10) also indicate strong predictive accuracy compared to the rest.In this paper, time series forecasting, TCNs, LSTM and GRU networks showed strong capabilities in capturing temporal dependencies and trends within the wind energy data. Visualization techniques were employed to compare model performances comprehensively, providing clear insights into their predictive power. Therefore, this present study offers a robust framework for researchers and practitioners aiming to leverage machine learning and time series forecasting in the realm of renewable energy prediction.",

Within the scope of this research, annual business data from 2021 to 2023 are used. In this context, this study compared the forecast performances of different machine learning (ML) methods (XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM) by analyzing them using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations), an XAI method. Some variables in this study consist of non-financial indicators, while the others consist of financial accounting and market-based indicators. The results show that renewable energy consumption has a very limited negative effect on ROA, whereas an increase in the total renewable energy ratio provides a positive contribution to ROA, albeit at a low level. Renewable energy consumption has a low positive effect on ROE. The XGBoost for ROA and Random Forest algorithm for ROE were more successful in estimation. This study goes beyond traditional statistical analyses and reveals the financial effects of accounting indicators in detail using XAI-based methods and contributes to enterprises’ decision-making processes regarding energy transformation.",

A year’s worth of 10-min interval data is trained, with two subsequent months forecasted by each model. The False Nearest Neighbors algorithm optimizes the embedding dimension for the chaotic analysis, and an optimized Echo State Network, achieving an R-squared above 0.97, is used for accurate forecasting. Additional models include Long-Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit (DL), eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest (EL), and Extreme Learning Machine and Feed Forward Neural Network (ML). Each model is optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, a Bayesian optimization approach. Evaluation metrics reveal all models performed well with the integration of endogenous and exogenous variables, with LSTM achieving the best results.

The results show that deep learning models outperform classical methods such as ARIMA, with transformers and LSTM models excelling at handling erratic and steady energy consumption patterns, respectively.\r\nIn particular, hybrid CNN-LSTM architectures provide the highest level of accuracy, with prediction accuracy improved by up to 20\\%. While improving grid stability and renewable energy integration, this development has the potential to reduce operational costs by up to 30\\%.

Seven ML methods, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), stacked LSTM, convolutional neural network (CNN), CNN–LSTM, deep neural network (DNN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and encoder–decoder (ED), were evaluated on two different datasets. The first dataset contains the weather and power generation data. It encompasses two distinct datasets, hourly energy demand data and hourly weather data in Spain, while the second dataset includes power output generated by the photovoltaic panels at 12 locations. This study deploys regularization approaches, including early stopping, neuron dropping, and\n            L2\n            regularization, to reduce the overfitting problem associated with DL models. The LSTM and MLP models show superior performance. Their validation data exhibit exceptionally low root mean square error values. The results demonstrate that DL models consistently outperform traditional ARIMA models, with validation RMSE values ranging from 0.038 to 0.074, compared to ARIMA's much higher values ranging from 0.154 to 0.191. Specifically, stacked LSTM achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.037, while ED reached 0.043 at higher validation splits. In the second dataset, the regularized time-distributed MLP outperformed others with RMSE values as low as 0.121, confirming the effectiveness of regularization.",

This work presents a smart green energy management system (SGEMS) that integrates a machine learning model and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize energy consumption and solar generation across a green campus. Using historical data from three campus buildings, we developed a predictive model to forecast short-term energy consumption and solar generation. The XGBoost algorithm, combined with RL, demonstrated superior performance in predicting energy consumption and generation, outperforming other models with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.72, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.00, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.18%. This work proposes a web-based interface for real-time energy monitoring and decision-making, helping users forecast power shortages and manage energy usage effectively.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n               The effects of climate change on renewable energy generation are of growing concern, as shifts in weather patterns and extreme events can significantly impact energy production. This study aims to leverage machine learning models to predict renewable energy generation based on the surrounding climate. We analyze data from four key states: California, New York, Florida, and Georgia, and focus on three critical renewable energy sources: hydroelectric, solar, and wind power. To determine the optimal model, we test six primary machine learning techniques, as well as an ensemble and a mean-only baseline. The results indicate that the ensemble approach improves the predictive accuracy of the model. Using this ensemble, we projected the changes to climate-sensitive portion of the renewable energy generation under climate change. Our results indicated that there was a wide variation of possible futures, depending on the state, source, and season. For example, the model projected a reduction in California’s monthly total renewable energy generation in the summer by 0.5%, or about 30 000 MWh, under SSP5-8.5, the worst-case scenario, but an increase of 0.5%, or about 25 000 MWh, in New York’s monthly total summer renewable energy generation under the same scenario. The modeling techniques detailed in this study can be applied across new regions, sources, or time periods. Ultimately, by understanding the influence of climate on renewable energy generation, we can improve the long-term planning process for the electricity grid, while building resilience and ensuring sustainable climate change mitigation and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "In the realm of renewable energy, harnessing wind power efficiently is crucial for establishing a low-carbon power system. However, the intermittent and uncertain nature of wind speed poses significant challenges for accurate prediction, which is essential for effective grid integration and dispatch management. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel hybrid model, NRBO-TXAD, which integrates a Newton–Raphson-based optimizer (NRBO) with a Transformer and XGBoost, further enhanced by adaptive denoising techniques. The interquartile range–adaptive moving average filter (IQR-AMAF) method is employed to preprocess the data by removing outliers and smoothing the data, thereby improving the quality of the input. The NRBO efficiently optimizes the hyperparameters of the Transformer, thereby enhancing its learning performance. Meanwhile, XGBoost is utilized to compensate for any residual prediction errors. The effectiveness of the proposed model was validated using two real-world wind speed datasets. Among eight models, including LSTM, Informer, and hybrid baselines, NRBO-TXAD demonstrated superior performance. Specifically, for Case 1, NRBO-TXAD achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 11.24% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2551. For Case 2, the MAPE was 4.90%, and the RMSE was 0.2976. Under single-step forecasting, the MAPE for Case 2 was as low as 2.32%. Moreover, the model exhibited remarkable robustness across multiple time steps. These results confirm the model’s effectiveness in capturing wind speed fluctuations and long-range dependencies, making it a reliable solution for short-term wind forecasting. This research not only contributes to the field of signal analysis and machine learning but also highlights the potential of hybrid models in addressing complex prediction tasks within the context of artificial intelligence.",

      "abstract": "AbstractRedeploying plants may mitigate climate risk and enhance renewable power generation. However, designing deployment strategies is complicated by the lack of plant‐level response between power generation and climate variables with the constraint of economic and social factors. Here, we develop three random‐forest (RF) response models that accurately capture the nonlinear relationship between renewable energy generation (hydro, solar, and wind power) and climate parameters at the plant level, using a 17‐year historical data set. These RF models enable projections of renewable energy generation from both existing and newly built power plants under the Representative Concentration Pathways and the Shared Social‐Economic Pathways (RCP‐SSP) scenarios, as well as deployment strategies. Our analysis reveals that renewable energy generation from existing plants is projected to decrease significantly by 6%–8% (57–72 TWh) in 2045–2060 compared to the period 2002–2017. The impact of climate change on renewable energy generation varies spatially, suggesting optimizing the deployment of newly built power plants could mitigate adverse effects. Compared to the strategy maintaining the original deployment, national renewable energy generation can be increased by 24%–28% through optimized deployment tailored to future climate. The optimized deployment can lead to synergistic reductions in carbon emissions by 25%–28% and air pollutants by 42%–97%. These findings underscore the significance of considering plant‐level heterogeneity and climate risk in the strategic deployment of renewable power systems.",

      "abstract": "Agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) in Africa, a region highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Rising food demand and expanding cultivation are intensifying the challenge of balancing productivity with environmental sustainability. Although previous studies have examined aggregate CO₂ emissions in resource-dependent economies, limited attention has been given to agriculture-specific emissions and their interactions with renewable energy use, natural resource dependency, and technological innovation. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the determinants of agricultural CO₂ (ACO₂) emissions in 41 African countries from 1996 to 2023, using econometric methods including Fixed Effects (FE), Random Effects (RE), Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE), and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) together with seven machine learning models to assess both linear and nonlinear dynamics. The results indicate that renewable energy adoption reduces ACO₂ emissions, whereas reliance on natural resources and technological innovations under current practices increases emissions, raising concerns about rebound effects and unsustainable resource use. Causality analysis reveals reciprocal relationships between renewable energy, natural resources, and ACO₂ emissions, while technological innovations exert a unidirectional effect. Among the machine learning approaches tested, the Extra Trees model achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Feature importance analysis confirmed the role of renewable energy, natural resources, and technology in shaping emission outcomes. These findings provide critical policy guidance, emphasizing the need for low-carbon energy transitions, sustainable resource governance, and inclusive climate-smart technological strategies to advance resilient agricultural development in Africa.",
