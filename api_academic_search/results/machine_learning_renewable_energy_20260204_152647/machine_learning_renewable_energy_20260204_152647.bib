               The effects of climate change on renewable energy generation are of growing concern, as shifts in weather patterns and extreme events can significantly impact energy production. This study aims to leverage machine learning models to predict renewable energy generation based on the surrounding climate. We analyze data from four key states: California, New York, Florida, and Georgia, and focus on three critical renewable energy sources: hydroelectric, solar, and wind power.},
