> Abstract
                  China has formulated ambitious but costly renewable energy targets for carbon reduction, energy security, and rural revitalization. However, nearly 13.2%-35.3% of Chinese are still suffering from energy-poor. As the transformation of energy structure accelerates, whether the expansion of renewable energy can alleviate energy poverty is rarely discussed. Therefore, this paper collects panel data from 30 provinces and regions in China from 2004 to 2020, and uses the diff...
